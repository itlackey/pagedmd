:::: ability

#### Punishing Counter

1. **0 AP** When an enemy within reach rolls a tough choice or worse on a basic attack against you, you parry their attack and take no damage. If they roll a failure or worse, you may also immediately  **ROLL THE DIE!** to make a basic attack on them. This counterattack does not count as an action on your turn. You can use this ability only once per round.
1. **1 AP** When an enemy within reach rolls a tough choice or worse on a basic attack against you, you parry their attack and take no damage. You may also immediately **ROLL THE DIE!** to make a basic attack on them to knock them prone, push them into a nearby area, or move into an area nearby doing 1 damage with this option. Using this ability does not count as an action on your turn. You can use this ability only once per round.
1. **1 AP** When an enemy you can see attacks you with a ranged weapon and rolls a tough choice or worse on a basic attack against you, you dodge their attack and take no damage. If they roll a failure or worse, you may also immediately **ROLL THE DIE!** to make a ranged basic attack on them if you have a ranged weapon and ammo available (you immediately stow whatever is in your hand(s) safely on your person). This counterattack does not count as an action on your turn. You can use this ability only once per round and the weapon you drew remains in your hand.

::::

:::: ability

#### RAGE HIT

1. **0 AP** **ROLL THE DIE!**  You attack with reckless power, disregarding your safety. This move should be a signature of its user. Describe it in detail in all its unorthodox glory!
1. **1 AP** **ROLL THE DIE TWICE!** You can make two basic attacks against one target. If either roll results in a 1, both rolls are considered catastrophes (consult your DM for their call on the horrible effect of your crap luck and/or choices 😂).

##### Outcomes

| Roll | Outcome  |
|------|---------|
| 20 | You deal quadruple damage (or double a special weapon's damage). |
| 11 - 19 | You deal double damage. |
| 6 - 10 | You deal double damage to the enemy, but they counterattack you. |
| 2 - 5 | You miss, and all enemies within reach may counterattack you immediately. |
|  1 | You fall prone and lose your next turn (or other detrimental effects at the DM's option). |


::::

:::: ability

#### Pain Compliance

1. **1 AP** You use strength and technique to overpower a commoner or minion within reach (you cannot use this ability on bosses). Describe how you overpower them. You put the target in a compromised position dealing 1 hit point of damage to them. They may spend their next turn escaping by making a basic attack against you (doing no damage), or they may try to attack you or another in range with a basic attack (rolling two dice and using the lower result). While overpowered, basic attacks hit the target for double damage. You can spend an action on your next turn to continue controlling them (and dealing 1 damage doing so), or releasing them.
1. **2 AP** All the effects from the 1 AP version above and choose one of their limbs to make useless until the end of the encounter.
1. **2 AP** **ROLL A DIE!** All the effects from the 1 AP version above and if your roll succeeds, you can pry one item off the target it has on its person or in its grip.
1. **3 AP** All the effects from the 1 AP version above and the target can only move to a nearby area if they chooses to move once you release them. It may not perform any other actions if it chooses to move. This effect lasts until the end of the scene.

1. **0 AP** Make a nearby creature angry at you by saying something or making a rude gesture. Your target must be able to understand your intent.

#### Bodycover

> Always be in-between danger and your principle.

1. **1 AP** If a nearby NPC is about to attack someone, you may rush to intercept the attack. You must say you're using this ability as soon as the DM declares the attack.

::::

:::: ability

#### Blitz

> When you have to close the gap, do it fast and go hard.

1. **1 AP** **ROLL A DIE!** You sprint toward a target in range that you have a clear line of sight and can move to and make a basic attack against them. If you roll a success or a triumph, they take double damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn (unable to take any actions whatsoever). This cannot be used against targets in reach.
1. **2 AP** In an instant, you choose a point in range that you want to reach and can move to. You explode through any foes in your path, knocking them down and dealing 1 damage to each of them. Targets you knock down cannot use special abilities during their next turn. Once you reach your destination, you can attack one target in reach for 4 damage.

When completed, your party recovers an additional 3 HP from regrouping.

::::

:::: ability

#### Battle Cry

- Size Up
- Field Requisition

::::

:::: ability

#### Size Up

> The easiest way to end the fight is to take out the biggest threat first. The hard part is telling who's the biggest threat.

 1. **0 AP**  You can take one look at a mob and know who's the boss. The DM will give you a peep into their skill sets, strengths, vulnerabilities, and/or resistances. Bare bones, you will catch whether you can walk through 'em, you're an even match, or you're cruzin for a bruisin.

The DM will hep you to the opposition's stats narratively. For example, they might say "you see the glampunks shaking and sweating in the cold. They must be strung out on something and don't seem fit enough to put up a good fight" rather than spilling that you'd be able to stomp them easy with your crew at full power.

::::

:::: ability

#### Field Requisition

> Pack yr ness gear wit chu, but snag ya sup from da enemy on yr march.

1. **1 AP** When you're on the move, you can find enough food and water to fill your crew's bellies now and enough for the next meal as well. This can only be used once per rest.

1. **2  AP**  You can attempt to heal yourself. **ROLL A DIE!**


<small>

- If you roll a 6-10, you heal 2 hit points but the experience is not pleasant (you or the DM can elaborate on this)
- If you roll a 2-5, your faith forsakes you and your charge. You must pray harder!
- If you roll a 1, you fail to heal the target and look weak in your faith in front of believers or like a scam artist in the midsts of those outside your tradition.

:::: ability

#### Avow

> What sort of ruffians would accost an innocent in the open?! Stand and deliver!

1. **0 AP** Once per scene, you may assert a reason for intervening in a matter, steeling your resolve. The reason should be based on your ideal and the scene's context. For example, if you believe in order, you might confront a swipe gang when you see them at work. Or, if you believe in generosity, you might drop some cred on them so they take a brake and spare society for a byte.

Choose one result:

- You immediately make a successful basic attack on a nearby creature.
- You compel an NPC to explain what they are doing (they may lie to you).
- You convince commoners to leave.
- There may be other things you can do...If you have an idea, consult your DM.

- A request, like "I ask for strength."

#### Invoke

> Leaving this meatbag behind is the best experience most fear even to try.

1. **3 AP** You leave your worldly body behind and create an astral projection of yourself. You must be in a quiet place with no other creatures around to begin the ritual.

While in this trance, you can only vaguely sense if there is danger around your mortal body. You may exit the trance at any time.

Your mind enters a liminal plane of existence on the border of the Backplane and the Infinitum. You experience this place however you envision it to be; it might be a lush paradise in a nebula, an idyllic homestead, or a temple in the fires of creation (this is your chance to create).

If you have an allegiance to a deity, you meet with their avatar. If you hold no allegiance to a deity or if your deity is merely a figment of your character's imagination, you meet with an avatar of supernatural wisdom.

Set a timer. You may speak to the avatar for 1 minute about anything you like. If you ask any of these or similar questions, the Guide will give you a truthful answer:

- Am I on the right path to (fill in the blank)?
- Is (fill in the blank) who they say they are?
- Am I living up to my ideal?
- Have my actions unknowingly caused anyone harm?

:::: ability

#### Impression

> With a brisk but gentle touch, you bridge the gap between your two souls, gaining an intimate understanding of a creature's yearnings and fears.

1. **1 AP** You brush against a creature for a fleeting moment, feeling its desires. The DM chooses and reveals to you something specific that the creature routinely craves. You become cursed to also crave that thing and cannot use Impression again until you fulfill the desire. When you fulfill it once, the curse is lifted.
::::

:::: ability

#### All-Seeing Eye

> In a moment of serene focus, the veil of reality lifts, granting you a glimpse into the hearts of all beings surrounding you.

1. **2 AP** You pause, closing your eyes and quieting your mind. The physical world falls away and you can see all sentient beings within a 50 meter radius omnidirectional sphere. Focusing in on one creature for a round, you can discern whether it is a target you could best in combat, an even match, or something to fear.
::::


:::: learning-path

### Verdicts

- Forgive
::::

:::: ability

#### Inspire

> You're not hardcore, unless you live hardcore. You sir....ARE HARDCORE!!!

 1. **1  AP** You inspire a nearby NPC by reciting a meaningful statement to them. You may invent a famous quote or proverb, or borrow one from the real world. The creature must be able to hear and understand you, and cannot currently be hostile toward you.

For a shortwhile, the NPC shapes their behavior around their ideal, and cannot fall victim to any personal flaws.
::::

:::: ability

#### Compel Truth

> LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND SAY THAT AGAIN!

 1. **1  AP** Your eyes glow like blue flames as you look into the eyes of a nearby creature and grip their mind.

**ROLL THE DIE!**

- If you roll a 20, the target is compelled to answer all questions truthfully for the next 5 minutes. <br />You may set a real timer.
- On 11 to 19, the target is compelled to answer three questions truthfully.
- On 6 to 10, the target is compelled to answer one question truthfully.
- On 2 to 5, the target resists your invasion and senses you tried to manipulate them.
- On a 1, the ability backfires. The target may compel you to answer a question truthfully instead.
::::

:::: ability

#### Forgive

> All in the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go of regret and holding on to your virtues.

 1. **3  AP** While placing your hand on a creature and telling them they are forgiven, they immediately feel guilt fade from their conscience. You must know a specific act or circumstance that the creature feels guilty for. Your words of forgiveness must be in the form of a Petition.

If you use this on a commoner or minion, they will become awestruck as if they have received a blessing from a god. They may begin to follow you as if you are a prophet, and they will not willingly cause you harm.

If you use this on a boss, you will temporarily endear them to you. They will not harm you until the next time you meet, unless you or the party tries to harm them. They cannot be affected by this spell twice.

:::: ability

#### Code Switch

1. **1 AP** You know the common slang of DimmCitz or have picked up on a local dialect and use it to gain the trust of a nearby commoner. You must invent a local saying to exchange with the NPC; it can be something like "It's always brighter outside The Dark" or "Smart chimps use tools." Explain what it means at the table.

- Is anyone causing trouble?
- Where can I find the leader?

::::

:::: ability

> Neon lights paint the scene, I spit rhymes, make it gleam. Hearts ignite, vibes take flight, in this rhythm, we unite to fight! Fight! FIGHT!!!

#### Quick Fix

> Nature's swift antidote or sumthin over-the-counter, dispels ailments and neutralizes poison alike.

1. **1 AP** You scavenge your area for a shorty to find a plant-based remedy or something more conventional for an ailment. You find enough for a single dose. The remedy cures temporary illness and eliminates poison.
::::

:::: ability

#### Stealth Camp Shroud

> Wildlife weaves concealment, guarding campfire glow, granting rest 'midst nature's shadow.

1. **3 AP** By sharing some nutrients or water with the nearby flora and fauna, you entreat them to provide the party with protection while camping in the urban jungle or wilderness (If there are no plants nearby, you can do a bit of gardening on the fly). Shrubs and thorny vines will emerge around your selected campsite to provide concealment. The shroud lasts until you decide to break camp to go elsewhere.

The shroud conceals the light from a small campfire or lantern. If hostile creatures advance on the enshrouded campsite, the surrounding wildlife and plant life will provide 5 minutes of early warning. Creatures can pass through the shroud if they know its true nature, but they are hit for 1 HP if they push or try to bushwack their way through.

When you regroup inside of the Shroud, your party gains the benefit of a rest.

Within the next day, you will meet an NPC Streetwarden who comes to your aid. Out of respect for you as a colleague, they will stay with you until they finish helping you with a request. Your request cannot be unlimited, and they will not stay with you forever.

The NPC Ranger has 10 hit points and comes with equipment of the DM's choice. You can ask them to do things, but they are an independent character who will ultimately act according to their own interests and ideals.

### Summoner

:::: ability

#### Vine of Thorns

> Needlevine darts from your outstretched hands, simultaneously ensnaring and poisoning your enemy.

1. **1 AP** You open your palm, conjuring a thorn-covered vine that you shoot directly at a nearby target creature or object. The target takes 2 HP of damage and becomes unable to use a move action.

**Roll the die!**

If you roll a 20, the thorn's poison is amplified. If you hit an organic creature, its skin swells, it loses sight beyond its reach, and it can't speak or cast spells until the end of its next turn.

The target can escape if it or an ally makes a successful (11-19) basic attack against the vine, with a Triumph (20) causing the vine to rebound on you for 2 damage.

If the target cannot escape, you can continue to immobilize it for another round by maintaining it with an action and dealing 2 more damage.

You can maintain the thorny vine until the target escapes or dies.

::::

:::: ability

#### Wild Font

> A touch awakens abundance, turning humble vessels into cascading founts of plenty.

1. **1 AP** You touch a container holding food, beverage, or oil. For a few tics, the container summons a surplus of its contents, spilling the excess material out generously.

For example, if you touch a pitcher of water, it will overflow and cover the floor. Or if you touch a sack of grain, it will burst open, creating a large pile (the exact amount is the DM's call). It is suggested that you take appropriate measures to contain the excess before initiating this ability.

::::

:::: ability

#### Evening Star

> Using a minor celestial summons you illuminate the land with radiance seldom seen within the mists of the ether.

1. **2 AP** You summon a wisp of light high in the sky directly above you. (You must be outdoors to cast this spell.) For a byte, the wisp sheds light on a huge area, allowing you to see far in the distance. It matches your movement such that it is always located above you. The area the light touches looks as if it were lit by daylight.

### Elementalist

::::

:::: ability

#### Freezing Gust

> Better a blast of winter than summer's boiling blood.

2. **2 AP** You freeze a nearby commoner, minion, or object, encasing it in ice until you leave the scene. If you freeze a creature, it cannot move or act. The ice shatters and the creature is freed if it takes any additional damage. Bosses take 3 damage from this attack and must choose between moving or attacking on their next turn.

::::

:::: ability

#### Laserlight

> Light is a powerful weapon to wield in the umbrage of Dimm City!

1. **0 AP** You channel the ambient light around you, shaping it into an illuminating beam of energy. When this beam is directed at a target within range, the heat generated is sufficient to cause significant discomfort to a creature, but not enough to cause harm. Additionally, the beam destabilizes the target, causing any attacks made against it to be rolled with two dice, and the attacker can use the better of the two rolls until the start of your next turn.
2. **1 AP** You overcharge the spell and light up the target with radiant energy. The target takes 2 damage and is set ablaze with any attacks made against it to be rolled with two dice, and the attacker can use the better of the two rolls until the end of the target's next turn.

::::

:::: ability

#### Thunderbolt

> Shock and awe is a great strategy to utilize in battle. Both are part of the attack with a thunderbolt!

1. **4 AP** Choose a target creature or object you can see. A bolt of lightning strikes it from the sky or from your hands, dealing 8 damage and creating a deafening blast of thunder. If the creature has metal connected to their body, it becomes molten, burning them for an extra 2 HP and destroying it in the process. Up to 3 nearby creatures are knocked prone and all are deafened until the end of your next turn.

::::

:::: ability

#### Fireball

> A fireball is a great way to begin a fight and an even better way to end it.

1. **5 AP** You shape an orb of fire suspended in the air in front of you and send it streaking in a straight line toward a target you can see.

## The Cybersurgeon

### Cybersurgeon Instruments and Meds

Cybersurgeons rely on a variety of medical instruments and drugs to get the job done. However, these things can be lost, broken, or stolen just like any other object. The cybersurgeon may spend 1 AP to rebuild a broken item and must repay the AP cost of the ability for a lost item. Items must be rebuilt during downtime in the story. Other creatures may hold these items, but only the cybersurgeon can activate their capabilities.

#### Peep and Patch

> Time is money and your injuries are wasting both!

1. **1 AP** You Quickly examine a creature and provide first aid in the form of cleaning, sealing, and covering wounds. Your efforts immediately restore 5 HP but do not remove impairments, heal permanent wounds, or cure diseases.

#### Medicated Calm

> Thanks to modern chemistry, anxiety is now optional.

**Cybersurgeon Meds:** This procedure relies on meds that are paid for with the AP cost. If supply is compromised, it may not be available.

1. **1 AP** You dose a nearby creature with a cocktail of drugs, alleviating them of anxiety, pain, and discomfort for a byte or so. In this state, the creature cannot be affected by fear or confusion. For a brief tick, they feel better than they have ever felt before.

#### Accelerated Recovery

> I'm a good doc, but I'm better with a myriad ah nanobots knitting you up from the inside.

**Cybersurgeon Meds:** This procedure relies on meds that are paid for with the AP cost. If supply is compromised, it may not be available.

1. **2 AP** You inject a creature with a massive dose of nanotech and treat their external injuries as best you can on the fly, restoring all of their hit points. After a shorty, the creature is relieved of any minor impairments. The operation does not remove permanent conditions.

If you are using Accelerated Recovery on another member of the party, they may contribute any amount of their own AP to help pay for the procedure.

**Cybersurgeon Instruments:** This procedure relies on having a TechMech Kit. If access to a TechMech Kit is compromised, using this ability may be impossible.

1. **2 AP** You spend a shorty running a custom program that purges a cybernetically enhanced creature of any malware, errors, compatability issues, or viruses that may be present in their system. The next time the creature must make a roll to pass a CYBERNETICS TEST, they instantly succeed. This perk lasts a fullwhile and the user knows when its effectiveness ends.

**Cybersurgeon Instruments:** This procedure requires an operating room or theatre, medical instruments, and components all paid for with the AP/DC cost. If supply is compromised or the facilities unavailable, this procedure cannot be attempted.

1. **1 AP/100 DC Per Ego Point** When a cybernetically augmented creature takes damage, their augments more often than not, take damage too. When an augmentation (or a mod) needs repair to function again, you or the recipient may contribute any amount of AP to help pay for the procedure. Alternatively, Dream Credits can be used to pay the cost of this ability. AP and DC can be combined as well.

**Cybersurgeon Meds:** This procedure relies on meds that are paid for with the AP cost. If supply is compromised, you lose use of this ability.

1. **1 AP** You spray a creature within reach with a modified casting agent, forming a flexible armor plate. During this, the formula of the spray also numbs the affected to external pain (making them immune to pain-related effects). The hardened shell absorbs up to 2 HP from physical hits. Any physical damage dealt in excess of 2 HP hits the creature normally. The creature's skin returns to normal after a long tick or so.

#### Dead to the World

> Few regard the dead as a threat. This ruse can prove useful in times of need.

1. **3 AP** You place up to six nearby creatures in suspended animation for a byte or two using a chemical that slows bodily function to a crawl.
(You may only use this ability on yourself or willing allies.) Creatures in this state cannot see, feel, speak, or move, but they remain semiconscious and can hear what is happening around them.

Affected creatures become cold to the touch, and their pulse is undetectable, appearing to be dead to onlookers. Only magic or sensitive diagnostic technology can reveal the ruse. Affected creatures wake immediately if they are harmed and may choose to wake at any moment.

Once per round, when a nearby foe attacks a creature other than you, you harness the power of the Flanking Foray. In that decisive moment, you become a fleeting specter, ghosting through the periphery of the battlefield. Seizing the opportunity, you exploit your adversary's focus, maneuvering swiftly behind them with precision and cunning to perform one of the following actions:

1. **0 AP** **ROLL TWO DICE!** You make a basic attack on the target that does double damage (quadruple damage on a roll of natural 20) if the better of the two dice result in a 11-20. Rolls of less than (1-10) that miss.
1. **1 AP** A master of anatomy, you target the pressure points of a commoner or minion, inducing a temporary state of unconsciousness, leaving them incapacitated for a quick while or until they suffer harm.
1. **3 AP** You kill a commoner or minion instantly. Describe how you wipe them from this substantiality.
::::

:::: ability

#### Toxins of the Trade

> The most depraved assassins watch with grim fascination as victims succumb to poison's effects, their fate sealed by the clandestine artistry of this deadly craft. Are you one of them?

**Wirephreak Gear**: This ability relies on tech that is paid for with the AP cost. If supply to this tech is compromised, you lose use of this ability.

You could teach a master's class on the variety of ways you know to create potent poisons. With one use of this ability, you create enough poison for a single dose. You can fine-tune the dose to be coated on weapons, put it in drinks or meals, have it be absorbed through the skin, or serve it to a creature directly. Regardless of delivery method, each use of the poison can only affect one creature.

Choose any combination of effects by paying the cost of each:

1. **1 AP** **Deep Dream:** The victim falls asleep for a quick while.
1. **2 AP** **Hellfire Venin:** The victim writhes in extreme pain for a byte, is dazed (can't use abilities), and is unable to speak.
1. **3 AP** **The Toxin that Binds:** The victim collapses and is paralyzed for a long while.
1. **4 AP** **Heartseeker:** Commoners and minions are instantly killed. Bosses are hit for 10 damage.
1. **6 AP** **Constrictor:** Clear poison. The victim experiences no symptoms and dies 1 week later. (This does not kill bosses but they do take 10 damage.)

1. **2 AP** Assassins in DimmC utilize a variety of discrete hand cannons that employ a silent piston-driven charge to propel a slug.

They can look like a traditional firearm, be disguised as an umbrella or a comlink, or even cybernetically implanted into the operator's body (choose which upon selection of this ability). It's rare to find these weapons without smartlink technology to track the target and almost perfectly guide the wielder's hand to make a deadly accurate shot on any nearby target in the scene. The shot hits for 6 damage and instantly kills commoners and minions. You must spend the AP cost to use this ability or the AP cost and one entire turn to recharge the weapon for another shot.

If you have time to assemble a proper disguise beforehand or are in possession of a disguise kit, you can pull off misrepresenting yourself using your near-flawless facade. The disguise automatically fools all you encounter, but some may question you if you act suspiciously.

1. **1 AP** Any place where people are, you may find objects to use to put together a passable disguise.

Depending on where you are, the disguise will offer at least one signature element of your deception, like a uniform, a membership insignia, or a style of dress. The disguise automatically fools commoners, but minions and bosses may question you.

:::: ability

#### Mirror Stash

> It was the most amazing trick! That grey drew some symbol on his bare chest with his finger and proceed to pull a clown car worth of stuff outta there!

Estronian technology is one of the most useful imports into Dimm City and its citizens benefit greatly from the alien tech. Mirror Stashes are one of the most popular among the rogues of DimmC because it allows a large amount of loot to be nearly flawlessly hidden with low risk to the user. All it takes is a pin prick implant and you're ready to stow and retrieve your items in The Mirror. You open a portal using a special chip embedded in your finger that is activated by drawing a unique design with that digit. When activated, the chip turns the surface drawn upon into a portal to a stash spot in The Mirror where almost any object may be stored and is only accessable with that particular chip. The gate remains open for as long as you need it or until you leave the scene. This technology allows you to carry more than 12 items and can fit anything that can be pushed into a half-a-meter wide opening. It does have it's limits (DM's discression) and the more stuff you pack in, the harder it is to find what you're looking for in a pinch.

**Wirephreak Gear**: This ability relies on tech that is paid for upon selection and is always implanted into a digit. If this tech is compromised, extracted, or out of your possession, you lose use of this ability.

1. **3 AP** You draw your personal seal on a surface with your chipped finger.

A portal opens and you can remove items previously stored or stash new loot (up to the size of an average human body) in the cache. The Mirror is a fairly safe place to store stuff, but who's to say your stash won't be found by something on the other side? Beware!

1. **2 AP** If you know the general whereabouts of a sentient quarry or item you need to procure, you can track them/it down with a combination of information gathering and observation. Tracking down something or someone like this can take a long byte, but the legwork almost always pays off.

**ROLL A DIE!**

- If you roll a 20, the target or item is easy to find and you can walk right up to take the next step.
- On 11 to 19, the target is a bit more elusive and you may have to stake out a few places and drop some creds to finally make contact.
- On 6 to 10, the target is really hard to find. You exhaust yourself pounding the pavement but finally get word after dropping a bit more cash than you wanted and doing a bit too much legwork.
- On 2 to 5, the target gets wind of you or those holding get spooked by you trying to track them down. Try again, sucker!
- On a 1, the target or someone working in the trade gets the jump on you. It's up to the DM to tell you what happens next.

#### Bug

> The mercsercs had me surrounded inna instant. I dinnt know how they found me until the bug dropped off and flew away. FML!!!

**Wirephreak Gear:** This ability relies on tech that is paid for upon selection. If this tech is compromised or out of your possession, you lose use of this ability.

Bugs come in different shapes and sizes, but only psychos use the same type consistently as a calling card of sorts. Bugs can fly, jump, climb, and swim. They can be programmed to move independently, but usually they're piloted like a drone until they hit their mark and attach to them. Most phreaks use whatever bugs they can get a hold of and alter it to suit their needs:

1. **X AP - Beacon Bug** Shaped like a lightning bug, these devices are used to track targets and can be followed on any comm system with the appropriate app. The piloted version costs 1 AP, while the auto-tracking version costs 2 AP and once this cost is paid, the bug can be used again and again. A successful hit destroys the bug.

1. **X AP - Wirefly** Tiny and stealthy, these spindly flies can secure themselves to anything, providing high-quality audio and video indefinitely. The piloted version costs 1 AP, while the auto-tracking version costs 2 AP and once this cost is paid, the bug can be used again and again. A successful hit destroys the bug.

1. **3 AP - Butcher Roach** This bug is designed to be anything from a nuisance to an assassin. It has a thick exoskeleton with springsteel legs that make crushing it nigh impossible.

On the attack, it acts independently in the same round as you and does 2 damage per hit if you **ROLL A DIE!** and the result is a success (11-19) or better. On a triumph (20), the butcher roach dazes the target and they cannot use abilities until the end of their next turn. This attack can also be used to deliver a dose from the **Toxins of the Trade** ability (this bug has a payload of two doses). All versions of this bug use auto-tracking (but can be piloted) and can be used again and again. Two successful hits on it destroys a butcher roach with one damaging it and requiring repair before being used again.

**TODO: FIX THIS**

#### Bug (cont'd.)

1. **4 AP - Sentipede**

With its long, segmented body and numerous pairs of legs that can reconfigure to any port, easily penetrating most physical terminals and exposed hardware, this unassuming arthropod is a true locksmith.
Once latched onto a system, the Sentipede transforms from its unpretentious appearance into a silent storm of code and commands, driven by a shrewdly trained AI. It diligently gathers intelligence, relays information, and even devises tactics for achieving complete control. Armed with autonomous hacking capabilities and a basic cyber deck, the Sentipede functions as a one-bug army, adept at breaching entry-level systems (limited to one card slot). It excels at monitoring and spoofing systems but isn't much use in heavy situations. If it takes any damage through cybercombat or an IRL attack, it is destroyed.

This optic implant or HUD housed in a pair of mirrorshades lets you see in natural darkness as if it were daylight. The gear can be permanently upgraded (spend the Adventure Points listed only once) with these capabilities:

1. **3 AP**  **ZOOM IN/ZOOM OUT** Add the ability to magnify the details of small nearby objects, or zoom to see faraway things clearly.
2. **4 AP** **IR Augmentation** Add infrared vision that lets you see an outline of things that are generating heat nearby. This ability works through most walls, ceilings, and floors. (DM's call).
3. **6 AP** Add the ability to detect whether something is an illusion. Illusions you detect appear to flicker and distort.
4. **0 AP** Each of the above modes can be toggled while using an augmented vision device by turning a dial on the side of the device or mentally switching if implanted.

Technosorcerer can cast powerful spells, but what makes them unique is that they use technology to make their magic even stronger. Each of their magical abilities has two forms: one that's purely magical and another that's magic combined with technology (boosting the abilities power). Technosorcerers can choose to cast a spell using magic alone, or if they have the option, can use the same spell but with the added boost of technology to make it really go bang! If they have been stripped of their tech or cannot access it for some reason, the technoenhanced version cannot be used.

1. **LIGHT** You create a harmless display of light, like a solid/flickering beam of light (similar to a flashlight) or a pattern of images. You can also snuff out or ignite small light sources like torches with concentrated sonic blasts or low-power lasers.

1. **MANIPULATE** You can teleport small items on your person into your hand from your pocket or vice versus. Any number of manipulations can occur as long as they are completely external (you cannot manipulate a bullet out of your abdomen, but you can shift a coin from your pocket to the top of your head).
1. **MARK** You can mark a color, insignia, or glyph upon an object or surface, which persists for a long byte. It can be up to a quarter of a meter squared.
1. **JUMP/DEPLETE** You can power a small nearby device (something no bigger than a boom box) for as long as you concentrate on it. This version of the ability also allows you to ROLL A DIE! to see if you can touch a target in reach. If you succeed, they take 1 lightning damage. You can also sap all the charge from a nearby device that's no bigger than a boom box. Once drained, it remains inactive until recharged.
1. **FLASHFREEZE/REHEAT** You can cool or freeze an item just as you can heat it to near combustion (you cannot burn it). This version of the ability also allows you to ROLL A DIE! to see if you can touch a target in reach. If you succeed, they take 1 fire or cold damage.
1. **FASTEN/LOOSEN** You can manipulate any one fastener (screws, nuts/bolts, nails, tacks, zippers, snaps, Velcro, etc.) within reach and affix or remove it from a fixed position. This ability breaks any welds or soldering when loosening a fastener and also repairs any stripping or damage to the fastener, leaving it in perfect working order (DM's call). Fasteners that fall into difficult to access cracks and creavaces can be recalled into your hand with a simple snap of your fingers.

Locked in a state of confusion, the rhino mercserc stands frozen, unable to move, act, or even respond, until your enigmatic display ceases.

(The spell does not work if the target has no other enemies nearby.) This effect is canceled if you harm the creature.
Technoenhancement:

1 AP you seize control of a random piece of technology worn by another commoner, minion, or boss within range. This manipulation compels the device to emit an insult or taunt directed at any creatures near the target of this spell who currently harbor hostility toward you. This cunning tactic redirects the anger of all commoners and minions in proximity toward the chosen adversary you've singled out, leading to arguments, skirmishes, or even full-fledged fights until the end of their next turn. Note that this effect will not function if the chosen target has no other enemies in close proximity and will be nullified should you or any of your crew harm any of the involved creatures. ::::

If a creature attempts to target you, you must flip a coin. If it turns up "heads," you are targeted; on "tails" one of your duplicates is targeted. If one of your duplicates takes damage, it disappears. These phonies last for a quickwhile or until the end of the encounter.

The illusion relentlessly mocks and taunts your target, provoking their full attention. You may control the illusion directly and have it manipulate small objects. For example, you can have it steal an item from the target and lead them on a chase. Or you may let the illusion go wild, allowing the Dream Master to narrate its behavior. This figment of their imagination lasts for a quickwhile or until the end of the encounter.

**Technoenhancement:**

1. **2 AP** You activate a specialized program that scours the WorldNet for an commoner, minion, or bosses social media posts and uses that data to produce an illusion of a creature they find extremely horrifying. Only you and the target of this hack can see and hear the arcane illusion you cast into existence. For a quickwhile, the illusion relentlessly taunts and jump scares your target, provoking their full attention. When first encountering this horrifying paramnesia, players must  **ROLL THE DIE!** If they fail, they are frozen in fear and lose their first turn. After the first turn, the target is dazed and cannot use any abilities while in the creeper's presence. You may control the illusion directly and have it manipulate small objects.

Only you and the target of the spell can see and hear the illusion. If you hit with this attack (rolling a 11-20), the illusory apparition makes a grievous wound on the target, spilling its guts and spraying blood everywhere in the target's mind but not in reality. Until the end of their next turn they can take no action and are proned as they attempt to hold their mangled body together. This diabolical hallucination remains for a quickwhile, until the end of the encounter, or the target is reduced to 0 HP.

This attack kills commoners and minions outright as their last moments literally scare them to death. Bosses can take no action and are proned as they attempt to hold their mangled body together and can be attacked again on your next turn using your action.

#### Forceshot

> Channeling the force of The Infinitum to manifest a devastating missile, you unleash its power with a flick of your wrist and it finds its mark with unerring precision.

1. **0 AP** **ROLL THE DIE!** You hold your open hand palm up and a shimmering missile of force appears. You throw it in a straight line at a target you can see, dealing 2 damage.
1. **2 AP** You overload the missile, increasing its damage to 4 and hitting the target automatically knocking them prone. You do not need to roll the die if you choose to use this version of the spell.
1. **2 AP** You overload the missile, splitting it into 4 different magical bolts each with a damage of 1 and hitting a target you can see automatically. If you hit a target with more than one of these missiles, it is knocked prone. You do not need to roll the die if you choose to use this version of the spell.

#### Flaming Fingers

> Your touch sets the world ablaze, igniting the very elements at your command.

1. **0 AP** **Firestarter:** You rub your hands together, causing a flammable object you can see nearby to ignite in flame. The spell can ignite textiles, wood, paper, and other combustible material. This spell cannot be used directly on creatures, but it can be used to ignite flammable things they are wearing or carrying. Igniting something on a creature deals 1 damage to them.
1. **2 AP** **Flamethrower:** You hold both hands palms up and pinkies touching. As soon as the digits meet, they spark, launching a fan of flame that engulfs up to 3 nearby creatures doing 2 HP of fire damage to each of them.
1. **0 AP** **Fan the Fire:** On the next turn of a creature within range that you targeted with the Firestarter or Flamethrower version of this ability, you can swiftly make a fanning motion to stoke the smoldering remnants of energy, feeding them and dealing 2 fire damage. This attack must occur on the creature's next turn after you targeted them with one of this abilities options or the opportunity is lost. The use of this ability doesn't count as an action on your turn.

#### Lightfooted

> Elevate your crew with the ability to run on air and move without a sound.

1. **2 AP** You bestow yourself and up to 5 creatures in range with magic that allows them to float on air. Affected creatures hover 1 meter above the ground and can move by gliding in the direction they want to travel for a shorty or until they wish to move normally. They will also fall gently until they are hovering 1 meter above ground when descending from aloft. Creatures affected by the Lightfooted spell make very little noise in motion. This can be cast in reaction to you or two or more allies (up to 5) falling in range and does not take an action on your turn in this case.
1. **1 AP** You can enchant one single creature in range (or yourself) with the Lightfooted spell detailed above. This can also be cast in reaction to falling (or someone else falling) and does not take an action on your turn in this case.

#### Wallcrawler

> The arachnid within appears when called, allowing you to scale walls and ensnare your foes in silken webbing.

1. **1 AP** You or one willing creature you touch gains the ability to climb and move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings. Climbing in this way leaves only one hand free at any one point in time, but you can have both free if you do not move during your turn.
1. **1 AP** You can launch a magical silk cord at anything in range and anchor it on the target, be it a weight-bearing surface or a creature.

If using it against a creature, **ROLL A DIE!** If successful, you restrain that creature until they **ROLL A DIE!** and succeed with an 11-20 at the end of their turn, are assisted by a creature with a cutting tool, or until the end of the encounter.

### Conjuration

> Harness the boundless power of arcane summoning, forging items with your magical force and creating connections with creatures and allies from the vast reaches of existence.

- Familiar Spirit
- Transcendent Lubricant
- Conjure Item
::::

:::: ability

#### Familiar Spirit

> With a whispered incantation, a tiny ally appears, forged from dreams and guided by your will.

1. **2 AP** You summon a tiny creature, such as a bird, lizard, butterfly, small robot/drone, homunculus, imp, or anything of comparable size. The familiar spirit becomes your ally, following your instructions. You or the Dream Master (or both together) can determine the creature's form, background, and personality. Either of you can speak on its behalf (usually you, but the DM may have reason to do so). The familiar spirit might choose to leave if mistreated.

The familiar spirit can deliver and fetch items it can carry at your command (DM's call). It may be able to pick up and move objects no larger than a coin purse and not heavier than 10 pounds. If you don't require its presence or if circumstances are perilous, you can allow it to rest (essentially, it will venture off on its own and live its life independently). You can summon it back at any time with it teleporting to your side instantly. It cannot engage in combat.

Your familiar spirit has 5 HP and is invulnerable to non-magical harm. If it is reduced to 0 HP, it vanishes and your bond is broken. You may only have one familiar spirit at a time.

#### Transcendent Lubricant

> Got some bots on your tail? Nuttin like a little slippery skeet skeet to stop 'em in er tracks!

1. **2 AP** A tried-and-true dirty trick of many a mage is to cast this spell to grease up a choke point and watch pursuers wipe out as they run through. This conjuration can be used to cover a 5-meter square surface in range with 50 liters of goo, completely coat a creature and all their accoutrement with 10 liters, or douse one item nearby with 5 liters. The variations of this spell all last for a byte.

When cast on an area, creatures standing in it need to immediately **ROLL A DIE!** Those that fail the check with a result of 1-10 fall prone. Those that enter the area also need to ROLL A DIE! and succeed with a 11-20 to remain standing. Moving through the area requires your full move and action because of the perilousness of the surface (this applies even if you are crawling). Those that enter it running fall automatically (no roll allowed) and take 2 damage. If a creature ends its turn in the area standing, they must ROLL A DIE! and succeed with a 11-20 to remain standing. If you are standing in the Transcendent Lubricant and attempt and action, you must ROLL A DIE! and succeed with a 11-20 to remain standing and complete your action. Failing this roll wastes your action. Dousing the area in 100 liters of alcohol or scrubbing it with soap and water for a shorty nullifies the effect of this spell.

When cast on an individual creature, they have to successfully **ROLL A DIE!** to take any action whatsoever. They must do the same if they start their turn standing and if they end their turn standing. If they want to hold or manipulate any item, they must successfully roll to do so or it is rocketed out of their hand (DM calls where it lands). To rid oneself of this condition, the affected creature must either be doused in 2 liters of alcohol (for a medium-sized individual) or spend a long tick scrubbing with soap and water.

Lastly, if cast on an item, any creature that attempts to manipulate the object must successfully roll to do so or it is rocketed out of their hand (DM calls where it lands). Dousing the object with 1 liter of alcohol or scrubbing it with soap and water for a long tick nullifies this spell.

#### Conjure Item

> Harnessing your imagination, you can manifest objects into reality. Some of these items are better than others...

1. **3 AP** You imagine an object, causing it to appear somewhere nearby. You can summon any object that meets these guidelines:
    - It can't be larger than an elephant.
    - It can't have magical effects or be a weapon of mass destruction.

You must tell the DM what object you want to summon. Then, they think of a related object and gives you its name in secret. (For example, if you want to summon a lockpick, the Guide may tell you to draw a door, a door hinge, a doorknob, or a deadbolt lock all depending on the technological level of the pick).

**START THE CLOCK!** You have 1 minute to draw the secret object. When time is up, show it to your party. Your friends can discuss what they see, but they can only submit one guess. Don't give the party clues. If they guess correctly, the item appears. If they guess closely but not exactly, the item appears, but it has a defect. If they're totally wrong, a random misshapen item appears.
