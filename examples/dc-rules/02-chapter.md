# Dream Master's Notes

The following section provides guidance to the Dream Master such as:

- Combat in The Dimm City RPG should be dynamic and dicey.
- Use Theatre of the Mind, Sketch it Out, or Grid Yr Loins to handle detailing combat environments.
- Make the battlefield dynamic with Dynamic Terrain, Unfavorable Ground and Hazards, and Area of Effect Hazards.
- Utilize Time Pressure to create tension.

## Running the Game

### Scene and Encounter Setup

- Be descriptive in setting up scenes, considering all player senses.
- Adjust description detail based on scene importance.
- Use figurative language, similes, and metaphors for texture.
- Be flexible in scene design, adapting to player actions and ideas.
- Use player knowledge to make scenes relevant.

## Time

- **Tick/Tic**: Refers to a very short and indefinite period of time (seconds to a minute or so)
- **Shortly/Shorty**: Implies that something will happen soon or in the near future (within 30 minutes or so)
- **Bit/Byte**: Denotes a short, unspecified period of time (an hour to two)
- **While**: Indicates an indefinite period of time, often used when waiting or expecting something
- **Stretch**: Indicates a flexible extended period of time (months to years)


## Clues and Challenges

- Provide important, obvious details for players to notice.
- Populate scenes with at least three clues.
- Offer threat warnings, either imminent or looming.
- Seed scenes with role-play opportunities, inspiring character ideals or flaws.
- Hint at possible actions players can take.
- Plan for practicality, including abilities-based interactions.

## Consequences

- Create consequences for player actions or inactions.
- Consider wealth, health, reputation, feelings, and life/death impacts.
- Make consequences a result of heroic or unheroic actions.

## Rolling the Die

There are many factors that may grant Lucidity to dreamers on a roll or make things Surreal. For example, attacking a fallen opponent might grant you Lucidity on your attack, while attacking a standing opponent while downed may make your roll Surreal. Creative choices should lead to the benefit of Lucidity in a variety of situations, just as poor decisions and actions within the dream might make things Surreal for you.

- Roll the die only when a chance for failure makes things interesting.
- Only offer die rolls if success is possible.
- Roll the die for NPCs when they make attacks against the players.
- If multiple factors make things easier or harder, one should still roll only one additional die.
- If a dreamer or NPC is Lucid or Surreal and can reroll the dice due to an ability or other benefit, they can only reroll one of the dice, not both.
- As the Dream Master, you can also decide that the situation makes things easier or harder and grant Lucidity to your dreamers on a roll or make things Surreal.
- If you customize or create your own abilities and situations, design them around the rule of rolling the die.
- When rolling, if a result is unclear or botched, a reroll is probably in order.
- NPCs and some traps almost always require you to ROLL A DIE! when they make attacks against PCs or use abilities that require die rolls.
- If the action isn't having a direct affect on the dreamers, narrate what's happening unless you want to introduce a bit of chance into the NPCs choices.
- NPCs that roll a tough choice should face a setback the same as a dreamer would.
- When dreamers roll a tough choice on an attack, you might make it standard protocol to choose from dealing half damage or off-balancing themselves until the end of their next round.
- A Crew Clash is a flexible way to run an action scene like a chase or a negotiation. During a Crew Clash, PCs work together to overcome a variety of different challenges.
- Dreamers should ROLL THE DIE! each time they try to deal with the challenge, then the DM describes the consequences.
- Combat isn't static and should never be ran as such.

## Combat Scenes

Combat in The Dimm City RPG should be dynamic and dicey. The battlefield should match that description. Here are some ways to run a combat encounter or scene:

### Combat Styles

#### Theatre of the Mind

- This style puts the burden on the DM to describe every detail.
- It offers a more imaginative and immersive experience, fostering creativity as you and the dreamers visualize scenes without relying on maps or miniatures.
- It encourages dynamic and collaborative storytelling, quick decision-making, and flexibility in game mechanics, allowing for a more fluid and personalized gaming experience.

#### Sketch it Out

- The next way DMs can handle detailing combat environments is to draw up a "loose map" or do a quick sketch of the field.
- This approach provides a visual reference without strict adherence to precise measurements.
- It allows for a middle ground between the detailed precision of grid-based maps and the freeform nature of Theatre of the Mind.

#### Grid Yr Loins

- Using a grid is all about tactical minutiae.
- This is a great way to play other, more tactical games, but that being said, using a grid in this system is a bit like mounting a scope on a hand grenade.
- It's a lot of work setting up for a run and you'll have to house rule distance, movement, and a myriad of other things.

#### Make the Battlefield Go Ballistic

- After you have decided which style of play you're going to use, the next step is to design the battlefield and make that location dynamic.
- Combat happening in a void is boring and will drag down the best of your efforts.
- When you put a modicum of effort into designing an interactive and changeable field of play, your dream will be way more about the world and the PCs in it than the ruleset you're playing by.

#### Dynamic Terrain

- Large overhead cargo containers suspended by advanced anti-gravity technology or a locking mechanism could serve as a dynamic environmental element.
- These containers could be part of the city's transportation or delivery system, hovering above busy streets or alleys or locked into underpasses.
- They are also a great way to store seldom used, but expensive equipment out of the way.

#### Unfavorable Ground and Hazards

- It's tough to actually stand and fight on uneven ground or move tactically while dodging hazards that can damage or immobilize you.
- Slime covered stone in a carbon monoxide filled sewer, or an ice covered staircase under a ceiling of falling icesickles are two especially good examples of this topic.

#### Area of Effect Hazards

- Area of Effect Hazards can also hinder and or benefit PCs on the battlefield.
- Signal jammers that prevent smooth communication, EMP bursts that knock out electronics for a few rounds or until repaired, single-use/reloading traps, or sonic weapons that off-balance creatures in their range are just a few examples of this type of hazard.

#### Time is an Illusion... Until it's Not

- Imagine your crew is three steps into a heist and everything is going according to plan, that is until the Wirephreak notices that a paddy wagon full of mercsercs are on their way to bust them.
- The tension that comes working under pressure is a magnificent part of a dream like this.
- Dreamers can plan and scheme all they want, but even the most carefully laid plans most times go dreadfully awry!

## Rounds and Turns

Combat in this system is run in rounds and turns, with the DM managing the NPCs' turns and health. A round lasts approximately 5 seconds of game time, with a turn being the allotted action of each PC within that round. During the party’s round, each player takes a turn to move and act, while during the DM’s round, each NPC takes a turn to do the same. Good DMs provide a detailed description of the consequences of each creature and PC’s actions immediately after they take them.

The order of turns can be determined in several ways:

### Dream Master's Call

The DM decides the order of turns for both players and NPCs, taking into account the situation and the story's context.

### Speed then Strategy

Players and NPCs can choose to act during the Speed Turn, taking one action or one move, but not both. The remaining players and NPCs act during the Strategy Turn, where they can both move and take an action.

### Each Side Rolls

At the start of each round, a crew leader and the DM roll a die, with the highest roll taking initiative for the round. The individual characters and NPCs' order of action can be determined by the Dream Master's Call or left to the players.

### Each Dreamer Rolls

At the beginning of the scene, each dreamer and NPC rolls a die, and the DM arranges the results in order as the first round is being played. The initial setup requires more time but can be streamlined by running the first round in increments of five.

These methods offer varying levels of complexity and randomness, allowing the DM to choose the one that best fits their group's preferences.
