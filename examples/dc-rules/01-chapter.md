# Dimm City RPG - Core v1.0

## Bring Light to Dimm City

Dimm City RPG is a rules lite system that drops you into the middle of a chaotic and surreal
metropolis filled with aliens, immortals, AI, cyborgs, spirits, and anthropomorphic 
entities known as Sporos. A minority of the populace are in the midst of a budding revolution against the authoritarian ruler, Daemon, and his army of supporters. It is up to you to choose your path of survival on the streets of Dimm City. Will you fight for freedom, just watch it slip away, or join the darkness creeping out from the mist?

Game sessions are referred to as "dreams" and the person guiding you, the dreamers through the story is referred to as the "Dream Master". The information provided in this document will outline the core game mechanics and rules to help you quickly understand how to enjoy dreaming with your friends and acquaintances.

## Dreaming Together

Ensuring player safety in TTRPGs is very important in some groups, achieved by fostering a supportive environment where concerns are openly communicated and addressed through active listening and collaboration and aided by clear communication guidelines and safety tools. Working with your Dream Master in session zero helps establish protocols for player safety, enhancing everyone's enjoyment and comfort at the table.

## Crew & Gear

**The game requires the following items:**

  - One or two 20-sided die
  - A character sheet
  - A copy of these rules, or the official Field Guide

**The game is best when played with 4 to 6 players:**

 - One player acts as the Dream Master (DM), or narrator of the story.
 - All other players creates their own Player Character or (PC).
 - PCs interact with the world through their actions and decisions.
 - PCs also collaborate with the DM in varying degrees to tell the story.

**The DM is responsible for the following aspects of the game:**
  
  - Seed the story or *dream* they want the crew to experience. 
  - Describing the people, places, and things the party encounters.
  - Playing the part of Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and monsters.
  - Communicating the result of success or failure.


<!-- 
Dimm City RPG is a collaborative experience and is meant to be engaging and fun for all players. Here are a few tips to ensure that everyone is having a good time.

- Be respectful to other players and the story you're creating together.
- Make sure everyone has a chance to speak without being interrupted or overpowered.
- Treat the DM well and show appreciation for their hard work.
- Leave the digital behind and embrace the analogue.
- Dream together and work as a team.
- Make sure everyone is comfortable with the content before proceeding.
- Keep it separated and speak clearly to avoid confusion.
- Leave some decisions up to chance.
- Be fair and have fun. -->

## Who Do You Dream to Be?

Every citizen of the city has a Citizen File (character sheet). Here is a list of the most important aspects to consider when creating a character. Please print and use the Citizen File in the appendix or use [dimm.city](https://dimm.city) complete the following steps:

- Choose a name, species, age/stage of life, height, weight, eye color, and skin color.
- Select their vibe, origin, current residence.
- Write a backstory, and dream for your character.
- Choose your character's ideal and flaw.
  - Some abilities interact with ideals or flaws to help or harm their character.
  - Your character's ideal should guide their behavior and be their moral core.
  - Your character's flaw should reflect the worst aspects of their personality.
- Decide on your character's specialty
- Select 6 starting abilities based on their specialty.
- Choose one common augmentation and one common mod if you like.
- Select up to 12 items to have on their person (PCs can only carry a total of 12 things).
   - If something is a kit, like an engineering or a medical kit, it only counts as one thing.
   - Clothes and other mundane items don't count against the character's limit (DM's call).

## Species

Since most citizens are Sporos, selecting a race can be a lot like picking your spirit animal. You can play whatever kind of being you can imagine (aliens, immortals like ‘angels', AI in a robot ‘hollow', or even a human), but it doesn't affect play mechanics in this basic version of the game (unless you have a DM that can balance your vision so as to not make your PC OP).

## Specialties

Each specialty has access to unique skill trees that allow you to unlock new abilities.

The available specialties are:

- Augmerc: A trained bodyguard or soldier upgraded with a variety of tech.
- Proxy: A guardian of their people and territory that gets power from the divine.
- Streetwarden: A protector of the cityscape and its flora, fauna, and citizens.
- Gutterdruid: Magus/Sages infused with power of elemental might.
- Cybersurgeon: A physician specializing in implanted tech and modifications.
- Wirephreak: Elite hacker, burglar, tech jail breaker or all three at once!
- Technosorcerer: A warlock whose patron is technology itself.
- Etherlock: A true spell-slinging master of arcana.

### Dual or General Specialists

- Dual Specialist: Combine two specialties and learn abilities from either role. The total number of abilities each character can learn is limited to 25.
- The Generalist: Mix any specialty's abilities and learn any combination of abilities from any available path. The total number of abilities each character can learn is limited to 20.

### Skill Trees

- Each ability is part of a skill tree that belongs to a particular specialty.
- Abilities are learned in the order they appear on the skill tree.
- Players can select abilities from any tree in their specialty and don't have to learn every option before choosing abilities from a different tree.
- Players gain access to a new ability of their choice that they can use in the next dream for each dream they survive.

### Augment Points (AP)

- Some abilities require Augment Points (AP) to use.
- Players begin the game with 10 AP and earn 5 AP or more at the end of each game session.
- AP is a finite resource, but if a player uses all of their AP, they can rest and gain 1 AP.
-Through resting multiple days in a row, PCs can accumulate up to the number of abilities they have in AP.
- Details about specialties and abilities are included in the appendix.

## Augs and Mods

The mental and physical risk of cybernetic enhancements is measured in Ego Points or EP, with higher ego sacrificed for greater risks. Ego Points are used to reflect the difficulty of balancing mind and body with extensive augmentation that pulls at your mental and physical health. As the dreamer's implant ego increases, the difficulty they have maintaining control of their augmentations increases as well.

- A player can have the following augmentations:
   - 1 Neurolink (assuming one brain)
   - 1 Skin augmentation
   - 1 Skeletal augmentation
   - 1 Nervous system augmentation
   - 1 per natural limb
   - 1 per natural eye socket
   - 1 per natural ear
   - 1 per voicebox
- Each augmentation may have up to 6 mod slots.
- Most natural limbs can support one mod slot (DM's call).
- Cybernetics can be purchased with Dream Credits (or AP in some specialties like the Wirephreak).
- Augs/Mods should be installed by a Cybersurgeon or another trained professional at a clinic or hospital.

### Ego Points (EP)

- Players start with 0 EP.
- Augs and mods may have an EP cost.
- EP cost is added to the PC's system ego when the aug or mod is installed.
- When EP exceeds 10, the dreamer loses control of their PC (because of the massive amount of errors, system instability, system hacks, etc.) until implants are removed and the out of control PC's system ego drops below 10.


### Cybersuck

- Specialties relying on arcane forces are adversely affected implant Ego.
- For each Ego point over 2, additional Augment Points (AP) are required to use abilities.
  - This effects the `Proxy`, `Gutterdruid`, and `Etherlock` specialties.
  - For each point over 2 Ego accumulated, 1 additional AP is required to use abilities.
  - Example: A Proxy with 3 Ego accumulated must spend 1 AP for an ability that normally costs 0 AP.
  - Example: With 4 EP, the cost increases to 2 AP extra, and so on.
- Technosorcerers are immune to `cybersuck` but are still subject to `SysChk` rolls.

### SysChk

Dream Masters should call for die rolls to maintain control of characters when it is appropriate and when failure has meaningful consequences.  A failed `SysChk` results in a PC entering a state of `SysFAIL`.

- **EP**: Measures the extent of augmentation and associated risks.
- **Risk Level**: Consequences can range from temporary ability loss, infection that impacts hit points, or to a system shutdown. Dreamers should be allowed to reattempt control rolls at the end of each of their turns.
- **SysCheck**: The number needed by the dreamer when they ROLL A DIE! to resist a `SysFAIL`of their cybernetics.

|  EP  |                       Outcome                       | SysChk |
| :--: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :----: |
| 1-2  |            Slim chance of control issues            |  6-7   |
| 3-4  |          Increased difficulty keeping a grip          |  8-10  |
| 5-6  |        Moderate challenges to functionality         |  9-13  |
| 7-8  | High susceptibility to manipulation and malfunction | 12-15  |
| 9-10 |      Extreme instability, system failures likely      | 15-20  |


### SysFAIL

Consequences of a SysFAIL can range from temporary ability loss to total system shutdown. 

- Some examples would be:
   - Mild issues like a temporary freeze of an augment's functionality.
   - Mobility issues or loss of the character's action for a round.
   - Total system shutdown lasting for a quicktick (one combat round) or more.
- The affected PC rolls each round to regain functionality or control.
- Roles like the Cybersurgeon, Technosorcerer, or Wirephreak can assist in recovery by spending their action or an ability that deals specifically with this problem.
- Assistance grants Lucidity to the next SysChk, allowing the affected PC to roll two dice and use the better result.

### Arm Yourself

Cyberarms in Dimm City are standard fare, but they're not just plug-and-play. These enhanced prosthetics can boost strength or dexterity, but at a cost to your ego. With mods galore, a cyberarm can be customized to fit various needs, but only professionals can optimize them for full power and agility. Cybersurgeons can swap out limbs in seconds, while others might take a bit longer. Lab-grown arms are another option, but they come with hefty price tags and wait times. If you want top performance, you'd better know the right expert—or risk getting stuck with a glitchy limb.

| Arm Augmentation | Slots | EC | Cost |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
|UniArm 100| 2 Mod Slots Available| 0|2,000 DC|
|Neurosseo-Integration Mount| 0 Mod Slots Available| 0| 1,500 DC|


| Hand/Forearm Augmentation | Slots | EC | Cost |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
|UniArm 100| 1 Mod Slot Available| 0|750 DC/1,250 DC|

This augmentation replaces the hand, forearm, or entire arm with a cybernetic version, initially without any ego cost. Various add-ons can be installed using modification slots, with little impact on ego. The full arm (not Hand/Forearm augments) can be optimized for strength or dexterity, requiring modification slots, ego, and a Neurosseo-integration Mount, with future adjustments possible through further modifications.

#### UniArm 100

Dentetsu subsidiary Uniarm produces some of the most basic prosthetics in the five districts. If you just want a working limb and are light on funds, the "Hundo" is the way to go.

### Modular Mastery: The Versatility of Cyberlimbs"

Prosthetic limbs in Dimm City can be extensively customized to suit various needs, with many mercsercs and blasters-for-hire owning multiple cyberlimbs tailored to specific challenges. Modding a limb offers tactical advantages, allowing users to prepare for a wide range of scenarios. Although mods can be installed in natural or lab-grown limbs (noted as *Bioware*), only one slot is typically available. The best-equipped operators prioritize adaptability, knowing it's better to have the right mod and not need it than to need it and not have it and face a mission unprepared.

| Mod | Slots | EC | BioWare| Cost |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
|POWERHOUSE Strength Enhancement| 1| 1|O| 1,000 DC/Arm|
|SwiftStrike Agility Enhancement| 1| 1|O| 1,750 DC/Arm|  
|ARMament Melee Weapon| 1| 1|X|750 DC|
|ARMament Blaster/Firearm| 1| 1|X|1,000 DC|
|Badger Clawz| 1| 0|O|650/Arm|
|HammerFist| 1| 0|O|500/Arm|
|Optalanges| 1| 0|X|250 DC/Hand|
|SnatchCatch| 2| 0|X|1,350 DC/Hand|

### Upgrade or Be Outclassed

A basic cyberarm is fine, but optimizing it for strength or agility requires a neurosseo-integration mount to fully connect it to the user's skeletal and nervous systems. This mount is also crucial for heavy-duty mods that enhance mobility and streamlines repairs, cutting service time in half for technicians. Countless mod options await savvy buyers in Dimm City. 

#### POWERHOUSE Strength Enhancement

The POWERHOUSE Strength Enhancement is designed to significantly boost physical strength. When equipped to a full cyberarm using a required neurosseo-integration mount, the user gains Lucidity (advantage) on all strength-related rolls with that arm, except melee attacks. If both cybernetic arms are  equipped with POWERHOUSE mods, rolling a 19 on strength-related tasks provides Lucidity on the next roll, just like a natural 20. Melee attacks also deal an additional point of damage (added after damage is doubled on a Triumph), making POWERHOUSE ideal for users seeking to exceed normal strength limitations to achieve an edge in combat.

#### SwiftStrike Agility Enhancement

The SwiftStrike Agility Enhancement optimizes neurosseo-integration mounted cyberarms for agility. Users with this mod gain Lucidity on all dexterity-related rolls when using the augmented arm. If both arms are SwiftStrike modified for agility, rolling a 19 on dexterity-related tasks grants Lucidity on the next roll as if it were a natural 20. Additionally, ranged attacks gain an extra point of damage (added after damage is doubled on a Triumph). SwiftStrike is perfect for those prioritizing speed and precision in combat, piloting, or other dexterity-driven tasks.

#### ARMament
DefendTech Systems' ARMament integrates discreet, powerful weapons directly into your prosthetic arm. Choose between a pop-up melee weapon (any type 25cm or under) for close combat or a precision blaster/firearm   for ranged engagements all hidden within your cyberarm. With ARMament, you're always armed and ready to survive!

##### Melee Weapon
| Roll  | Result      | Damage |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 20    | TRIUMPH     | 4 damage and target must ROLL A DIE! with a result of 11 or more or take 6 damage instead|
| 9-19 | Success     | 2 damage |
| 6-8  | Tough Choice| 2 Damage |

##### ARMament Blaster/Firearm
| Roll  | Result      | Damage |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 20    | TRIUMPH     | 4 damage and roll an extra attack|
| 9-19 | Success     | 2 damage |
| 6-8  | Tough Choice| 2 Damage |

#### Badger Clawz

Need to make 'em say, "Whoh! Watch out!"? Grab the Badger Clawz Deluxe—with up to five blades snapping out from the back of your hand! Perfect for slicing through trouble, or showing off just how few effs you actually give. Badger Clawz arm you always—whether it's cutting through a crowd or BS, you're locked, loaded, and ready to rip doing 2 damage instead of 1 without!

#### HammerFist 

The HammerFist augmentation, designed by Calm-Tek, integrates dendritic actuators and mechano-receptive fibers into a user's hand and forearm, boosting striking impact. With a ferrofluidic core to enhance punching mass and dispersion cabling for shockwave control, HammerFist increases unarmed attack damage by 1. This bonus stacks with any strength enhancements applied to the same prosthetic arm, making it a powerful offensive upgrade.

#### Optalanges 

Optalanges modify the user's prosthetic hand and fingers, each offering specialized minor effects. Common installations include a TechMech Kit or TactMed Kit, functioning as versatile tool collections. A Bypass Kit is also an option but is typically available only through underground surgeries. Other specialty kits can be installed, though these three are the most prevalent.

#### SnatchCatch

The SnatchCatch is a cybernetic hand enhancement equipped with a gyrojet propulsion system, allowing the user to launch and retract their hand on a cable that supports up to 250 kg. Once projected, the user must roll to hit the target. If successful, the target is securely caught, and creatures must use an action to TOLL A DIE! with a result of 11 or better to break free. The hand can be used to pull the user toward a fixed object or reel in items and creatures. The gyrojet recharges after three rounds using ambient air.

### Step Up or Get Left Behind

In Dimm City, cyberlegs are a must for anyone looking to outpace the chaos. Seamlessly integrated via custom cuffs or skeletal mounts, these upgrades offer enhanced endurance, speed, agility, and jumping power, allowing users to navigate the urban jungle with ease. Skilled cybersurgeons can swap them out quickly, while poorly fitted mods from less experienced techs can lead to suboptimal performance. For those serious about survival, cyberlegs are the key to keeping ahead of the pack.

| Aug | Slots Available | Ego Cost | Dream Credits |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
|Redi-Mobile| 2 Mod Slots Available| 0| 3,500 DC|
|Neurosseo-Integration Mount| 0 Mod Slots Available| 0| 2,000 DC|

| Aug | Slots | EC |DC |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
|Redi-Mobile| 1 Mod Slot Available| 0|750 DC/1,250 DC|

This augmentation replaces the foot, lower leg, or entire leg with a cybernetic version, initially requiring no ego cost. Add-ons can be installed using modification slots, with minimal impact on ego. The full leg (not Foot/Calf augments) can be optimized for strength or dexterity, requiring modification slots, ego, and a Neurosseo-integration Mount, with further adjustments possible through additional work.

#### Redi-Mobile Cyberlegs

Redi-Mobile, produced by RediMotion, offers an affordable and reliable entry-level option for cybernetic limb replacements. Designed for those seeking functional mobility solutions, these cyberlegs provide dependable performance, making them ideal for users recovering from injury or seeking cost-effective enhancements.

|Strength Enhancement| 1| 1| O| 1,500 DC/Leg|  
|Agility Enhancement| 1| 1| O| 2,500 DC/Leg|
| Auto-Holster| 1| 0| X| 800 DC/Leg|
| Grav-Razors| 1| 0| X| 550 DC|
| MagLock Treads | 1| 0| O| 250 DC/Leg|
| QuickFix Injector| 2| 0| X| 1200 DC|
| Shin Sluggers| 1| 0| O| 750 DC/Leg|

### Leap Into the Future

Enhance both strength, agility, or functionality by upgrading natural or cybernetic legs. For cyberleg users, a specialized neurosseo-integration mount reinforces the hip girdle, ensuring seamless connection to the skeletal and nervous systems and is required for both strength and agility enhancements. This mount improves stability and reduces service time, enabling quicker maintenance and customization for peak performance on streets and battlefields throughout the monoverse.

#### HercuLeg Strength Enhancement

The HercuLeg Strength Enhancement boosts leg strength and endurance, allowing you to roll with Lucidity (advantage) on all strength/endurance-related rolls involving your leg(s). When both cyberlegs are enhanced, rolling a 19 and up on checks related to Strength/endurance grants Lucidity on your next roll. Kick-based melee attacks deal an additional point of damage, the user gains the Jump trait, and never becomes fatigued from long-distance movement.

#### Lightfoot Agility Enhancement

The Lightfoot Agility Enhancement optimizes cyberlegs for agility, granting Lucidity on all agility-related rolls. When both legs are upgraded, a roll of 19 counts as a natural 20 for agility rolls involving the PC's legs. Additionally, the user gains the Mobile trait, enhancing movement on solid ground or when using mods like Icarus Kicks.

### Step Up or Tap Out

Cybernetic prostheses are a game-changer, but with the right mods, they're a lifesaver for those in high-stakes situations. These enhancements boost mobility, tactics, and weapon retention, making them essential for anyone who depends on their legs for survival—or avoiding a trip to the recovery room!

#### Auto-Holster

The Auto-Holster is a hydraulic weapon storage system designed for discreet, rapid access to sidearms, providing enhanced mobility and minimal detection risk. Compatible with various firearm models, it allows for quick draws via neurolink or mechanical activation, optimizing weapon retention in high-pressure scenarios.

#### Grav-Razors

Grav-Razors are an enhancement for users with dual cyberlegs, enabling frictionless glide-skating through magnetic elevation. Integrated inertia dampeners and gyroscopic stabilizers provide precise control at high speeds. Users gain the Fleet trait while moving on solid ground, though falls during motion may result in severe injuries. External boot versions are available but lack the same prestige.

#### MagLock Treads

This cyberleg modification equips the soles of the user's cyberlegs with powerful magnetic clamps, enabling them to walk on metallic surfaces with ease. Whether scaling walls, walking upside down on ceilings, or clinging to the side of a speeding vehicle, MagLock Treads provide unparalleled stability and control in any high-risk environment. Ideal for covert operations or daring escapes, this mod ensures you'll never lose your footing, no matter the situation.

#### QuickFix Injector

The AutoFix Injector mod integrates up to six reservoirs within a cyberleg, each capable of storing a different drug. With a simple mental command via neurolink or triggered manually, the user can instantly inject any selected substance into their system, ensuring immediate absorption and maximum effect. Designed for quick responses in high-stress scenarios, the AutoFix Injector provides rapid boosts for enhanced performance, pain relief, or heightened focus, without the hassle of manual administration.

#### Shin Sluggers

Calm-Tek's Shin Sluggers integrate dendritic actuators and mechano-receptive fibers into prosthetic or biological limbs, enhancing striking impact with a ferrofluidic core and shockwave dispersion. This augmentation amplifies leg strength, increasing unarmed attack damage by one and delivering formidable force capable of denting steel or pulverizing bone.

### More Mods, More Mojo

Savvy cybertech enthusiasts understand that well-chosen modifications can offer extraordinary versatility. Installing certain enhancements in both upper and lower limbs can amplify power and unlock additional capabilities, though even a single modified limb can prove invaluable. The true utility of these mods will depend on your ambitions and the scenarios you face.

| Mod | Mod Cost | Ego Cost|BioWare| Cost |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----|--------| 
|FlyMod Climbing Augs| 1/hand or foot| 0|O| 800 DC/hand or foot|  
|FrogAugs™| 1/hand or foot| 0|O| 300 DC/hand or foot| 
|Nebula EMP Shield| 1| 0|X| 2,000 DC| 
|Smuggler's Stash|1-4|0|O|350 DC|

#### FlyMod Climbing Augmentations

Enhance your climbing abilities with FlyMods, which use biomimetic technology to replicate a fly's adhesive grip. Featuring mini suction cups and nanotubes, this augmentation provides superior traction on various surfaces. Installing FlyMods in both hands or feet grants the Climb trait, and using them in all four limbs also provides the Fleet trait while climbing. Note that these mods require dedicated limbs, necessitating the removal of other enhancements.

#### FrogAugs

Enhance your aquatic agility with FrogAugs, featuring advanced webbing and telescoping digits for superior swimming. Installing FrogAugs on both hands or feet grants the Swim trait, while full installation on both limbs provides both the Swim and Fleet traits. This mod requires exclusive hand or foot slots; existing mods must be removed prior to installation.

#### Nebula EMP Shield

Ensure your cyberware's resilience with the Nebula EMP Shield, designed to protect against electromagnetic pulses using advanced graphene modules. This shield provides 99.999% attenuation of electric fields up to 20kV/m, safeguarding crucial systems by making them effectively EMP immune. The corrosion-proof nanofilaments and easy integration into most cyberframes ensure reliable protection and long-term cost savings.

#### Smuggler's Stash

For discreetly transporting contraband, the Smuggler's Stash is your ideal solution. This small, hidden cavity (5cm x 10cm x 1cm) embedded in your prosthesis is shielded from most sensors, with a detection target number of 16. Accessing the stash can require up to a longtick (a minute) or more, depending on tools and expertise. Larger stashes can be created with additional mod slots, though increased size also raises detection risk(-1 to the target number for each added slot). The maximum size is 2 mod slots for an arm and 4 for a leg.

Bigg Mufz grants users immunity to hearing damage/deafness from sonic-based attacks and EMP attacks to their cyberear augmentations and other mods.

#### CombatCaster

When ambushed and outflanked, CombatCaster revolutionizes your auditory perception, offering unparalleled precision and clarity in the worst of situations. With the ability to rapidly pinpoint the direction of incoming sounds, filter out noise, and focus in on them with the ability of a shotgun mic, you gain a critical advantage in combat scenarios, allowing for quicker reactions to threats and potential dangers. 
 
This mod requires a Cybereye to track sound and to alert the user of the immediate direction from which it came in the HUD. If one sound in particular is of interest, others can be filtered out and more tightly focused on if the origin is in range of the user. When active against an invisible opponent in reach that is producing audible noise, the user has a normal chance of hitting them and ROLLS A DIE! unpenalized. While attacking an invisible opponent in range that is making noise with a ranged weapon, the roll is made Surreal. 

Sounds that are echoed off of surfaces can be visually traced to their origin if focused on (user sacrifices an action or movement). There are many different applications for this tech, so be creative (DM's call).

<!-- ## Living the Dream

The following sections describe the rules and mechanics used while dreaming in Dimm City. This includes dice rolls, combat, and other aspects of the game. -->
## ROLL A DIE!

- Players roll a 20-sided die to determine the outcome of actions.
- A roll of 20 is a critical success (Triumph), while a roll of 1 is a critical failure (Catastrophe).
- You might roll a 20 to try to do something, but not everything is possible, even with a Triumph!
- The DM decides the result of the roll based on the situation and the character's abilities.

| Roll     | Outcome                                                       |
| -------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 20       | Automatic success; next roll is *Lucid* (higher of two dice). |
| 11 to 19 | Success                                                       |
| 6 to 10  | Hard Choice (success with a cost)                                             |
| 2 to 5   | Failure                                                       |
| 1        | Severe setback; next roll is *Surreal* (lower of two dice).   |


## Lucid and Surreal Rolls

Rolling a lucky 20 or an unlucky 1 can either help or hinder a PC when they're attempting something risky, defending themselves, or hacking at an opponent.

- When multiple factors grant Lucidity or make the roll Surreal, roll only 1 additional die.
- If both Lucidity and Surreal states occur simultaneously, they cancel each other out. Roll normally.
- If a dreamer/NPC can reroll due to an ability/benefit, most times, they can only reroll one of the dice (DM's call).

| State   | Effect                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lucid   | The PC enters a state of "flow". When a dreamer becomes Lucid and they are next called upon to **ROLL A DIE!**, they instead roll two dice and use the higher result. |
| Surreal | The PC enters a languid, dream like state. When a dreamer becomes Surreal and they are required to **ROLL A DIE!** they roll two dice and use the lower number for that roll.      |

## Character Health (HP)

Your PC starts with 10 Hit Points (HP). 10 HP is the maximum a character can have without augmentation or special abilities. Losing HP occurs from damage by weapons, spells, or environmental hazards.

Unarmed attacks usually deal 1 damage. Common weapons, like blades and blasters, deal 2 damage. Armor and other defenses can reduce damage taken.

Injuries received while above 0 HP are merely flesh    wounds. When dropped to 0 HP, PCs are at death's door. PCs on death's door cannot take combat actions. Movement is allowed but the PC can only move to a space in reach, while moving to a nearby area takes two move actions.Other actions while on death's door may be allowed (opening doors, flipping switches), but are the DM's call.

When a character is at 0 HP and they take damage, they must **ROLL A DIE!**. If the result is equal to or less than the damage dealt, the character dies.

### Regroup

PCs have the option to `Regroup` and recover half of their missing HP (rounded down), with a minimum of 1 HP.

  - Regrouping takes a shorty (approximately 30 minutes or so of game time).
  - Pcs can only regroup once per cycle, and any interruptions that require strenuous activity or movement prevents healing.

### Rest

PCs have the option to `Rest` in a safe place to recover all HP.

  - Resting takes a longwhile (6-12 hours of game time).
  - Resting grants PCs 1 AP to a max equal to the number of abilities they have.

## Combat and Actions

- A character's actions in combat include moving, attacking, or using an item.
- During a turn (lasting a quicktick or 5 seconds), a character can move and do one thing, like attack, move again, help, defend, or use a special ability.
- Combat is turn-based, with each player and NPC getting a turn within a round (all involved get one turn within that round) to act.
- A `ROLL A DIE!` check determines the outcome of an attack or other risky actions.
- The DM decides whose turn it is based on what's happening in the dream (or with another system).
- The DM takes turns for all of the NPCs and creatures they control, making attacks and doing other things to hinder or defeat the PCs.

## Distances

The distance between a player and their target affects the type of attack they can use during combat.

- The DM decides how far away a target is and the players can choose to attack, move closer, or use a ranged attack.
- If the target is in reach, the player can attack it with a melee weapon.
- If the target is nearby, the player can move to be within reach of it during their turn and attack.
- If the target is in range, the player can attack it with a ranged weapon.
- If the target, is in range and they wish to melee attack it, they must use their move and action to close the gap and they can attack at the start of their next turn.
- If the target is too far, the player needs to spend two turns worth of all actions moving toward them to place themselves in range for a melee attack on their third turn.

## Hacking

Hacking requires a hacking device to participate in a hacking session. These devices are common and can be acquired easily and may be included in some cybernetic devices. Some specialties may be able to build their own hacking devices.

Hacking sessions work as normal combat with a few minor differences.

- The system is played as a single NPC and controlled by the DM.
- The system can counter attack after each players attack.
- Each player has a separate set of HP that is represents the hacking device.
- When the device HP reaches 0, it is disabled and unusable until repaired.
- To restore device HP, the player must spend time and credz to repair the device.
- Attacks do 1 point of damage, unless a modifier is applied.
- Range is not applicable.
- There is no action/move phase, the only option is to attack while hacking. Movement is possible in the analog world, just as long as you can stay connected to the system. 
- Abilities that provide advantages during hacking must be applied before the session begins.
- The DM can decide to limit the number of rounds the attackers have to defeat the system.

### Hacking Abilities

Some specialties can learn abilities to assist in hacking. The abilities typically have a lifespan of a number of rounds or a single hacking session.

They provide advantages such as:

- Providing additional HP to the device.
- Increasing the damage dealt by a player.
- Reducing the damage of an attack.
- Providing a player with lucidity.
- Forcing the defending system into a surreal state.
- Modifying the outcome of ROLL A DIE!

## Buying Things

- Currency in Dimm City is called DreamCredz (DC).
- Credz can be acquired by players in a variety of ways.
- They are only necessary to buy things that are not common or expensive.
- Basic goods, like meals, clothes, are considered free to those with an active ID chip.
- Players may also trade other goods or services for valuable items, gear, or meals.
- Cybernetics are common but the quality can vary greatly.
   - High-end gear will have a high-end price
   - Common gear can be acquired freely to those in need or at a low cost
