# Chapter 2: The Journey

Three months later, Sarah had written fifty thousand words. Not all of them were good—most weren't—but they existed, and that was something.

James had become a regular fixture at the coffee shop, always in the same corner, always with his leather journal. They'd developed a routine: arrive separately, nod acknowledgment, work in parallel silence for hours. Sometimes they'd share snippets, ask questions, offer encouragement.

"I killed off my protagonist," James announced one afternoon, looking up from his journal.

Sarah stopped typing. "What?"

"Chapter eighteen. Shot him." James demonstrated with finger guns. "Bang. Dead."

"Can you do that?"

"I just did."

"But... it's your protagonist. Don't you need him for the rest of the story?"

James grinned. "That's what makes it interesting. The story isn't about him anymore. It's about everyone he left behind."

Sarah sat back, considering. "That's either brilliant or insane."

"Most good ideas are both."

That night, Sarah couldn't sleep. James's words echoed in her mind. *The story isn't about him anymore.*

She'd been so focused on her main character, on making him perfect, on getting his arc exactly right, that she'd forgotten about everyone else. The supporting cast had become cardboard cutouts, existing only to serve the protagonist's journey.

She grabbed her laptop, sat cross-legged on her bed, and started reading her manuscript from the beginning. Really reading it, not just skimming for typos.

Her protagonist was a journalist investigating a conspiracy. Standard thriller fare. But his editor—a woman named Margaret who appeared in exactly three scenes—was far more interesting. A former war correspondent, scarred by what she'd seen, trying to protect the younger generation from making her mistakes.

What was Margaret's story?

Sarah opened a new document and started writing. Not about the journalist. About Margaret.

The words flowed like they hadn't in months. By 3 AM, she had fifteen thousand words of backstory, of history, of a character who'd been waiting in the wings for someone to notice her.

"I think I need to rewrite everything," Sarah told James the next day.

He didn't look up from his journal. "Good."

"Good? I just spent six months writing fifty thousand words."

"And now you know what story you're actually trying to tell. That's progress."

Sarah wanted to argue, but he was right. The journalist had been the wrong protagonist all along. This was Margaret's story. It always had been.

"How do you do it?" she asked. "How do you keep going when you realize you've been writing the wrong thing?"

James finally looked up. "Because the wrong thing led you to the right thing. You couldn't have found Margaret without first writing the journalist. It's all part of the process."

"The painful process."

"The only process."

They returned to work. Sarah opened a new document. At the top, she typed:

> **THE MARGARET CHRONICLES**
> *by Sarah Mitchell*

Then she started writing.
