# Chapter 3: The Discovery

Six months and a hundred and twenty thousand words later, Sarah typed two words she'd never thought she'd type:

**THE END**

She stared at them for a long moment, waiting to feel something. Relief? Pride? Accomplishment?

Instead, she felt empty. The characters who'd occupied her mind for a year were suddenly silent. Margaret's voice, so clear for so long, had gone quiet.

James looked up from his journal. "You finished?"

Sarah nodded, not trusting her voice.

"How does it feel?"

"Terrible."

James laughed. "That's how you know it's real. If it felt good, you'd have written the wrong ending."

The publishing industry, Sarah discovered, moved at a glacial pace. Queries went unanswered. Agents requested pages, then vanished. The few rejections she received were form letters, identical except for the signature.

"It's not personal," James reminded her over coffee. "They're looking for something specific, and if you're not it, you're not it."

"But what if I'm never it?"

"Then you write the next book."

Sarah had started to understand why James had been working on his novel for three years. It wasn't that he was slow. It was that publishing was a marathon disguised as a sprint. You ran and ran, and the finish line never seemed to get closer.

But then, on a Tuesday morning exactly one year after she'd first met James in the coffee shop, her phone rang.

"Is this Sarah Mitchell?"

"Yes?"

"This is Rachel Chen from Lighthouse Literary Agency. I read your manuscript, *The Margaret Chronicles*."

Sarah's heart stopped. Started. Raced.

"I'd like to represent you."

The celebration was quiet—just Sarah and James, the same coffee shop, the same corner table.

"You did it," James said, raising his cup.

"We'll see. She still has to sell it."

"She will. It's a good book, Sarah. Really good."

"How would you know? I never let you read it."

James smiled. "Because I've watched you write it. I've seen the way you show up every day, even when you don't want to. I've seen you throw away fifty thousand words and start over. That's not something you do for a bad book."

Sarah felt tears threatening. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For being here. For showing me it's possible."

"We're all just trying to make something real," James said. "The medium doesn't matter. Pen or keyboard, paper or pixels. What matters is that we show up and do the work."

Sarah thought about the woman she'd been a year ago, staring at a blinking cursor, waiting for inspiration. She'd been looking for the wrong thing. Inspiration didn't come from waiting. It came from doing.

"What about your book?" she asked. "When do you finish?"

James reopened his journal, picked up his pen. "When it's ready. Could be tomorrow, could be another three years. I'll know when I get there."

Sarah opened her laptop. A blank page waited. She'd already started thinking about the next book—Margaret's daughter, maybe, or her younger self during the war.

The cursor blinked, steady and patient.

Sarah started typing.

## Acknowledgments

To everyone who said "you should write a book"—I finally did it.

To James, real or imaginary—thank you for the coffee shop wisdom.

To Margaret—sorry I made you suffer, but that's what made you interesting.

And to anyone reading this who's staring at their own blinking cursor: just write. The words will come.
