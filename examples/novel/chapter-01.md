# Chapter 1: The Beginning

The rain fell in sheets against the window, each drop racing its neighbor down the glass. Sarah watched them from her desk, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, waiting for inspiration that refused to come.

*Write what you know,* they always said. But what did she know, really? Twenty-eight years of living, most of it spent in front of screens, typing words that would be read by strangers and judged by algorithms.

She glanced at the manuscript—thirty thousand words of a story that had seemed so clear in her mind just weeks ago. Now it sat there, mocking her with its incompleteness, its characters frozen mid-sentence, waiting for her to breathe life back into them.

A notification pinged on her phone. Another rejection. The email was polite, professional, impersonal. "Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, this doesn't fit our current needs."

Sarah closed her laptop with more force than necessary. The characters could wait another day. Maybe forever.

The coffee shop was crowded despite the rain—or perhaps because of it. People huddled over steaming mugs, seeking warmth and the comfort of being surrounded by strangers who expected nothing from them.

Sarah found a corner table and ordered her usual: black coffee, no sugar. She opened her laptop again, staring at the blinking cursor. It pulsed like a heartbeat, steady and insistent.

*Just write,* she told herself. *Stop thinking and just write.*

Her fingers found the keys.

> "The woman in the red coat appeared on Tuesday morning, standing in the rain without an umbrella, as if she'd been waiting there for centuries."

Sarah paused. Read it back. Deleted it.

> "The woman in the red coat stood in the rain, waiting."

Better. Simpler. She kept going.

"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"

Sarah looked up. A man in his thirties, holding a coffee and what looked like a leather-bound journal. She shook her head.

"Thanks." He sat down, arranged his things, opened the journal. Sarah noticed the handwritten pages, the neat cursive filling each line.

"You write by hand?" she asked before she could stop herself.

He looked up, smiled. "Always. There's something about the physical act of it. Pen on paper. It makes it real, you know?"

Sarah didn't know. Everything she'd ever written existed in the cloud, backed up across servers, ephemeral and eternal at the same time.

"I'm James," he said, extending a hand.

"Sarah."

His handshake was firm, warm. His eyes were kind.

"What are you working on?" he asked, nodding at her laptop.

"A novel. Or trying to. You?"

"Same. Been working on mine for three years now."

"Three years?" Sarah couldn't hide her surprise.

"It takes as long as it takes," James said, shrugging. "Hemingway rewrote the ending of *A Farewell to Arms* thirty-nine times."

"I've rewritten mine zero times because I can't seem to finish the first draft."

James laughed. "The first draft is the hardest. That's when you're making something from nothing. Every word after that is just making it better."

Sarah found herself smiling for the first time in weeks. "Is that from a writing book?"

"No, it's from three years of painful experience." He raised his coffee in a mock toast. "To painful experiences and the stories they become."

Sarah raised her own cup. "To painful experiences."

They drank in comfortable silence, two writers in a crowded coffee shop, each returning to their own worlds, their own characters, their own struggles with blank pages and blinking cursors.

Sarah's fingers found the keys again. The words came easier this time.
