# Part 2: The Descent

The upper levels of the catacombs are ancient burial chambers, their walls lined with alcoves containing skeletal remains. Dust and decay fill the air, and the silence is oppressive—broken only by the occasional drip of water and the party's footsteps.

## General Features

### Catacombs

All catacomb areas share these features unless noted otherwise:

- **Lighting:** None (pitch black)
- **Ceiling:** 10 feet high, carved from stone
- **Walls:** Ancient stonework, covered in dust and cobwebs
- **Floor:** Uneven stone, worn smooth by centuries of passage
- **Air:** Stale and cold, smells of earth and decay

### The Whispering

@roll{Wisdom saving throw DC 11}

Failure: The character hears faint whispering in a language they don't understand. The whispers are coming from deeper in the catacombs. Each hour spent in the catacombs, repeat this save. After 3 failures, the character begins to have disturbing visions (see sidebar).

#### Disturbing Visions

Characters who fail 3+ saves see fleeting images:
- Shadows moving when no light source changes
- Faces in the stone walls (not really there)
- Their companions with hollow, black eyes (illusion)

These visions provide no mechanical penalty but should create unease.

## Area 5: The Broken Seal

This circular chamber served as the main entrance to the catacombs. The walls are carved with religious symbols, now defaced and covered in strange runes.

### Features

- **Size:** 30 feet in diameter
- **Ceiling:** 15 feet high, domed
- **Notable:** A heavy stone door lies shattered on the floor
- **Lighting:** Faint phosphorescent fungi provide dim light

### What the Players See

> You enter a circular chamber with a domed ceiling. A massive stone door lies in pieces on the floor, as if smashed from within. The walls are covered in religious carvings—prayers for the dead, symbols of protection—but someone has defaced them with crude symbols painted in what looks like dried blood. The air here is even colder than the passage behind you, and your breath mists in the dim light of glowing fungi.

### Examination

@roll{Religion DC 13}

Success identifies the religious symbols as belonging to three different gods—Lathander (dawn/renewal), Kelemvor (death/the afterlife), and Helm (protection). The seal required the blessing of all three.

@roll{Arcana DC 14}

Success identifies the blood runes as crude but effective magic—they're designed to weaken divine wards. Someone knowledgeable but not skilled made them.

### Evidence

@roll{Investigation DC 12}

Success finds:
- Dried blood on the floor (1 week old)
- Candle stubs arranged in a circle (ritual components)
- A torn piece of black cloth (from cultist robes)
- Footprints leading deeper into the catacombs (3-4 people, medium humanoids)

## Area 6: The Burial Hall

A long corridor lined with burial alcoves. Each alcove contains a skeleton or pile of bones.

### Features

- **Size:** 60 feet long, 10 feet wide
- **Alcoves:** 20 alcoves total (10 per side)
- **Lighting:** None
- **Trap:** Pressure plate at the 30-foot mark

### The Trap

@roll{Perception DC 14}

Success notices that one floor stone sits slightly higher than the others.

**If triggered:**
- A grinding sound echoes through the hall
- Heavy stone blocks fall from the ceiling
- All creatures in a 10-foot area must make a @roll{Dexterity saving throw DC 13}
- Failure: 2d10 bludgeoning damage
- Success: Half damage

@roll{Thieves' Tools DC 13}

Success disarms the trap.

### The Alcoves

Most alcoves contain nothing but bones and dust. However:

**Alcove 7 (north side):**
Contains a skeleton wearing a silver holy symbol of Kelemvor (worth 50 gp, can be used as a material component for *Protection from Evil and Good*)

**Alcove 14 (south side):**
Contains a hidden compartment behind a loose stone.

@roll{Investigation DC 15}

Success finds: *Potion of Greater Healing* and 25 gp in ancient coins

## Encounter 1: Zombie Ambush

At the end of the burial hall, 6 zombies emerge from the alcoves and attack.

:::statblock
### Zombie (6)
*Medium undead, neutral evil*

**Armor Class** 8
**Hit Points** 22 (3d8 + 9)
**Speed** 20 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 13  | 6   | 16  | 3   | 6   | 5   |

**Saving Throws** Wis +0
**Damage Immunities** Poison
**Condition Immunities** Poisoned
**Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 8
**Languages** Understands all languages it spoke in life but can't speak

#### Traits

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

#### Actions

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
:::

### Tactics

- Zombies attack the nearest living creature
- They fight until destroyed
- If reduced to 0 HP, Undead Fortitude may keep them alive
- They pursue fleeing characters but cannot open doors

### Treasure

Zombies carry nothing of value, but one wears a key around its neck. The key opens the locked gate in area 9.

## Area 7: The Collapsed Chapel

This chamber was once an underground chapel. Now, part of the ceiling has collapsed, creating a pile of rubble in the center.

### Features

- **Size:** 40 feet by 30 feet
- **Ceiling:** 20 feet high (partially collapsed)
- **Rubble:** Difficult terrain in the center
- **Lighting:** None

### What the Players See

> You enter what appears to have been a chapel. Stone pews lie broken and scattered across the floor. An altar at the far end has been knocked over, its religious symbols chiseled away. Part of the ceiling has collapsed, creating a mound of rubble and broken stone in the center of the room. The air is thick with dust.

### The Rubble

@roll{Investigation DC 12}

Success finds a path through the rubble (no difficult terrain for the party).

@roll{Strength (Athletics) DC 13}

Success allows a character to climb the rubble and examine the hole in the ceiling. It leads up to the village chapel (area 1). This is where the breach occurred.

### The Altar

The altar has been intentionally destroyed. Examining it:

@roll{Religion DC 11}

Success identifies this as a chapel dedicated to Lathander. Someone made a deliberate effort to destroy all symbols of the god.

@roll{Perception DC 14}

Success finds a hidden compartment in the altar's base containing:
- *Spell Scroll of Bless*
- *Spell Scroll of Cure Wounds*
- A silver dagger (not magical, worth 10 gp)

@page-break

## Area 8: The Locked Sanctuary

A heavy wooden door blocks further progress. It's locked and reinforced with iron bands.

### The Door

**Lock:** @roll{Thieves' Tools DC 16} or the key from Thom (area 3) opens it

**Forcing the door:** @roll{Strength (Athletics) DC 18}

Failure by 5 or more triggers a magical alarm (all enemies in Part 3 are alerted)

### Beyond the Door

Once opened, the door reveals stairs descending into darkness. The temperature drops noticeably, and the whispers grow louder.

@roll{Wisdom saving throw DC 13}

Failure: The character hears their name whispered from below, in a voice that sounds like someone they loved who died.

**When the party descends the stairs, continue to Part 3: The Depths.**

@page-break

## DM Notes: Pacing and Tension

### Building Atmosphere

- Describe sounds: dripping water, distant echoes, the crunch of bones underfoot
- Use smell: must, decay, cold stone, burning incense (near cultist areas)
- Temperature shifts: growing colder as they descend
- The whispers should be subtle at first, growing more insistent

### Managing Resources

Players should use 1-2 spell slots and some hit dice in Part 2. If they're full strength going into Part 3, consider:
- Adding 2-3 more zombies to the ambush
- Making the trap more dangerous (3d10 damage)
- Adding a shadow to area 8 (ambushes from darkness)

### If Players Retreat

If the party returns to the village to rest:
- Father Aldric is understanding but worried
- Two more villagers fall to the sleeping sickness
- The party hears screams during the night (cultists have begun the ritual—time is running out)

### Alternative Solutions

Encourage creative problem-solving:
- Turning/destroying undead is very effective
- *Detect Magic* reveals lingering necromantic auras
- *Speak with Dead* on a zombie reveals fragmented memories: "...master calls...darkness hungers...feed the seal..."
