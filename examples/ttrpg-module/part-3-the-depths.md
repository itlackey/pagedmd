# Part 3: The Depths

The lower catacombs are older and more dangerous. The walls here are carved with ancient warnings in languages long forgotten. The whispers are constant now, pressing against the mind like cold fingers.

## Area 9: The Ritual Chamber

The stairs from area 8 descend 30 feet into a large chamber. Torches burn in wall sconces, illuminating a disturbing scene.

### What the Players See

> The stairs open into a vast chamber, easily 60 feet across. Torches burn in iron sconces, casting dancing shadows on walls covered in ancient carvings. In the center of the room, a circle of black candles surrounds a raised stone platform. Four figures in dark robes chant in unison, their voices creating a discordant harmony that makes your teeth ache. On the platform lies a sleeping villager, bound with rope. As you watch, shadows begin to coalesce above the platform, forming into something with too many angles and not enough substance.

### The Ritual

The cult has been conducting this ritual nightly for a week, feeding the Whispering Dark with life force drained from sleeping villagers. Tonight is the final night—if the ritual completes, a shadow demon will fully manifest.

**Ritual Progress:**
- When players arrive: 70% complete (7 rounds until summoning)
- Each round, another villager falls into the sleeping sickness
- At 10 rounds, the shadow demon manifests

@page-break

## After the Battle

Once all enemies are defeated:

### The Bound Villager

The villager on the platform is alive but unconscious. They can be awakened with healing magic or will wake naturally after 1 hour. They remember nothing of their ordeal.

### Examining the Chamber

@roll{Investigation DC 13}

Success finds:
- The ritual circle is permanently etched into the floor
- Five other sleeping villagers are hidden in alcoves around the chamber
- Malachi's journal details the entire plan

### The Journal

Malachi's journal reveals:
- He discovered the seal was weakening due to the passage of time
- He and his followers hastened the process with their own rituals
- The Whispering Dark promised them power in exchange for feeding it life force
- The entity is contained in a deeper chamber (area 10)
- Complete destruction requires destroying its anchor

@page-break

## Area 10: The Sealed Sanctum

A passage at the back of the ritual chamber leads to a heavy door carved with protective runes.

### The Door

The runes are ancient and powerful:

@roll{Arcana DC 15}

Success identifies these as containment runes designed to keep something IN, not keep people OUT.

**Opening the door:**
- Requires a @roll{Strength (Athletics) DC 16} check
- OR dispel magic (4th level or higher)
- OR Thom's key (from area 3) which causes the runes to glow and the door to open freely

### The Sanctum

> Beyond the door is a small chamber, barely 20 feet across. In the center stands a black stone obelisk, carved with symbols that hurt to look at. Shadows writhe around the obelisk like living things, and whispers fill your mind—promises of power, threats of death, pleading for release.

### The Obelisk

This is the anchor point for the Whispering Dark. Destroying it will banish the entity permanently.

**Options:**

**1. Physical Destruction**
- Requires dealing 75 damage to the obelisk
- AC 17, immunity to poison and psychic damage
- Each attack prompts a @roll{Wisdom saving throw DC 14} or take 2d8 psychic damage
- Radiant damage counts double

**2. Dispel Magic**
- Must be cast at 5th level or higher
- Lower levels: @roll{Spellcasting ability check DC 15}
- No saves required

**3. Re-sealing Ritual**
- Using Miriam's journal (from area 4)
- Requires 3 hours and components worth 50 gp
- Can be done with the obelisk intact
- Makes the entity dormant for centuries (not destroyed)

@page-break

## Concluding the Adventure

### If the Obelisk is Destroyed

- The whispers stop immediately
- All sleeping villagers wake up
- The shadows dissipate
- The catacombs become just old, empty tunnels

### If the Ritual is Re-Sealed

- The whispers fade but don't disappear entirely
- Sleeping villagers wake over the next day
- The entity remains, but contained
- Future generations may face this threat again

### Return to Thornhaven

The village celebrates the party's victory:
- Father Aldric holds a ceremony of thanks
- Thom crafts each party member a masterwork weapon (treat as +1 weapon, non-magical)
- Elder Miriam offers her home as a base of operations
- The village council awards the promised payment

### Future Hooks

- What other cults worship the Whispering Dark?
- Where did Brother Malachi learn about the entity?
- Are there other sealed sites in the region?
- What happened to the original cultists 200 years ago?

**Congratulations! The adventure is complete.**
