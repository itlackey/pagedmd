# The Cursed Catacombs

*A D&D 5e Adventure for 3rd-5th Level Characters*

## Adventure Synopsis

The quiet village of Thornhaven has been plagued by strange occurrences: crops withering overnight, livestock disappearing, and villagers reporting nightmares of a voice calling from beneath the earth. The party is hired to investigate the old catacombs beneath the village chapel, long sealed after a terrible plague two centuries ago.

What they discover is far worse than restless dead—an ancient cult has begun to stir, and their dark ritual threatens to unleash something that should have stayed buried.

## Adventure Hooks

### The Desperate Priest

Father Aldric approaches the party in desperation. His congregation is terrified, and he suspects the old catacombs have been breached. He offers 100 gold pieces and the church's blessing to anyone willing to investigate.

### Family Ties

One character receives a letter from a relative in Thornhaven, begging for help. Strange dreams have driven the character's grandmother to the brink of madness, and the village healers are powerless to help.

### Bounty Notice

A notice on the tavern board offers 200 gold pieces for anyone who can stop the "disturbances" in Thornhaven. The notice is signed by the village council and has been posted for three weeks with no takers.
