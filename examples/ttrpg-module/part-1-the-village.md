# Part 1: The Village

The party arrives in Thornhaven on a gray autumn morning. The village seems normal at first glance—a dozen buildings clustered around a small green, smoke rising from chimneys, chickens pecking in yards. But something feels wrong. The villagers hurry about their business with heads down, avoiding eye contact. Children play in whispers. The whole place has the feel of somewhere holding its breath.

## Area 1: The Chapel

The village chapel is a modest stone building with a peaked roof and narrow windows. Ivy creeps up the western wall, and the wooden door bears signs of age and weathering.

### Features

- **Architectural:** Simple stone construction, approximately 40 feet by 30 feet
- **Lighting:** Dim light during the day from narrow windows, candles at night
- **Ceiling:** 15 feet high with exposed wooden beams
- **Notable:** A large crack has appeared in the floor behind the altar

### What the Players See

> You enter a simple chapel that smells of old stone and candle wax. Wooden pews line both sides of a central aisle leading to a modest altar. Behind the altar, you notice a disturbing crack in the stone floor, wide enough that you could fit your arm inside. The crack appears recent—rubble and dust surround it.

### Father Aldric's Tale

Father Aldric is praying at the altar. He startles when the party enters but quickly composes himself.

**What He Knows:**

- The crack appeared three weeks ago during the night
- Nightmares began the same night
- The catacombs beneath were sealed 200 years ago after a plague
- He's afraid to investigate alone
- Several villagers have fallen ill with "the sleeping sickness"—they won't wake up

@roll{Religion DC 12}

Success reveals that the plague wasn't natural—it was a divine punishment for those who practiced dark magic in the catacombs.

### Examining the Crack

@roll{Investigation DC 10}

Success reveals:
- The crack is recent (within the last month)
- It leads down into darkness
- Faint scratch marks on the stones suggest something climbed OUT, not fell in
- A cold breeze carries the smell of decay

## Area 2: The Village Green

The village green is a simple square of grass with a well at the center. A few villagers linger here, but they're not socializing—they're arguing in hushed, urgent tones.

### Notable NPCs

**Goodwife Martha** - Worried mother whose son won't wake up
**Miller Garrett** - Angry, wants to seal the chapel and burn it
**Young Tom** - Saw something in the well last night (claims it was a shadow moving against the current)

### Information Gathering

@roll{Persuasion DC 12} or @roll{Intimidation DC 15}

Success reveals:
- Seven villagers have fallen into the sleeping sickness
- All of them reported nightmares of a voice calling from below
- The voice speaks in a language none of them understand
- Some villagers want to leave; others refuse to abandon their homes

### The Well

The well is 30 feet deep with water at the bottom.

@roll{Perception DC 14}

Success reveals strange scratch marks on the inner wall, as if something with claws climbed up from below. The marks descend deeper than the party can see.

**If investigated further:**

A character who descends the well (Athletics DC 10) discovers that the well connects to the catacombs through a narrow tunnel at the 20-foot mark. The tunnel is barely wide enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through.

## Area 3: Thom's Smithy

The smithy is a sturdy stone building with a large forge that fills the space with heat and the ring of hammer on anvil. Thom is working when the party arrives, shaping horseshoes with methodical precision.

### Thom's Information

Thom is reluctant to talk at first (@roll{Persuasion DC 13} to get him to open up).

**What He Knows:**

- He's been having the nightmares too, but won't admit it unless pressed
- His great-grandfather helped seal the catacombs
- The seal wasn't just physical—it was magical, blessed by three priests
- Whatever broke the seal did so from inside

**If the party gains his trust:**

Thom produces an old iron key, rust-pitted but serviceable.

*"My great-grandfather made this. Said it opens the old sanctuary deep below. I don't know what's down there, but he said anyone who went looking for it would need this. Reckon that's you."*

The key opens a locked door in area 8 of the catacombs (Part 2).

## Area 4: Elder Miriam's Home

Elder Miriam lives in a well-kept cottage at the edge of the village. Her home is filled with books, dried herbs, and the accumulated wisdom of seven decades.

### Meeting Miriam

Miriam is sharp-tongued and suspicious. She won't help the party unless they convince her they're serious about stopping the threat.

@roll{Insight DC 14}

Success reveals that Miriam is afraid—not of the party, but of what lies beneath the village. She knows something she's not saying.

### The Journal

If the party succeeds on a @roll{Persuasion DC 15} check or demonstrates genuine concern for the village, Miriam produces an old leather journal.

**The journal contains:**

- A map of the catacombs (partially complete)
- Notes about the original plague and the cult that caused it
- A warning: *"The Whispering Dark must not be named, must not be summoned, must not be fed. We sealed it in stone and silence. May future generations be wiser than we were."*
- A ritual for re-sealing the catacombs (requires 3 hours and components worth 50 gp)

**Important:** The journal gives the party advantage on checks to navigate the catacombs and reveals that the cult worshipped "The Whispering Dark," an entity from the Shadowfell.

## Moving Forward

Once the party has gathered enough information, they must decide how to proceed:

### Option 1: Enter Through the Chapel

The crack behind the altar leads directly to area 5 of the catacombs. This is the quickest route but bypasses some useful information in areas 5-7.

### Option 2: Enter Through the Well

The well connects to area 6. This route is more difficult (requires squeezing through a narrow tunnel) but allows the party to explore more thoroughly.

### Option 3: Find Another Entrance

@roll{Investigation DC 16} in the village

Success reveals that an old root cellar behind the abandoned mill has a hidden entrance to area 5. This entrance is trapped (see Part 2).

### Preparation

The party can purchase basic supplies in the village:
- Torches (1 cp each)
- Rope (1 gp for 50 feet)
- Holy water (25 gp per vial, Father Aldric has 3 available)
- Healing potions (50 gp each, the village healer has 2)

**When the party is ready to proceed, continue to Part 2: The Descent.**
