## Handouts

### Handout 1: Father Aldric's Letter

> *To whom this may reach,*
>
> *I write in desperation. Our village is plagued by nightmares, and I fear the cause lies beneath our very feet. The old catacombs have been breached, and something stirs in the darkness below.*
>
> *I offer 100 gold pieces to any brave souls willing to investigate and end this curse.*
>
> *Come quickly. With each passing night, more of my flock fall into an unnatural sleep from which they will not wake.*
>
> *May the light guide you,*
>
> *Father Aldric Whitestone*
> *Chapel of Lathander, Thornhaven*

### Handout 2: Journal Fragment

> *Year 203 of the Reign of King Aldric III*
>
> *The plague has claimed half the village. The healers are powerless against it. Elder Thom discovered the truth—it is no natural plague, but a curse born of dark magic practiced in the catacombs beneath the chapel.*
>
> *Those fools sought to commune with an entity from the Shadowfell, something they called the Whispering Dark. It promised them power but demanded life force in return. When they refused to continue feeding it, the entity turned their own magic against them, creating the plague that now ravages us.*
>
> *Tomorrow, three priests from the capital arrive to help us seal the catacombs. Thom says the seal must last forever, or at least until people forget the danger below. May future generations heed this warning: what lies beneath must never be disturbed.*

## Magic Items

### Ring of Mind Shielding

*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.

You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.

If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication.

### Unholy Dagger +1

*Weapon (dagger), uncommon*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this dagger, the target takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage.

**Curse:** This dagger is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by *remove curse* or similar magic. While cursed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this dagger.

### Dawnbringer Longsword

*Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Lost for ages in the catacombs, this sword glows with inner light. While you hold it, it sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight.

When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

## Running the Adventure: DM Tips

### Pacing

- **Part 1 (The Village):** 30-45 minutes
  - Let players roleplay and investigate
  - Don't rush them—information gathering is important

- **Part 2 (The Descent):** 1-2 hours
  - Build tension with descriptions
  - Use the whispers mechanic frequently
  - Consider a short rest before entering the locked sanctuary

- **Part 3 (The Depths):** 1.5-2 hours
  - The ritual creates urgency
  - Don't let players over-plan—time is limited
  - Make the final battle feel epic

### Adjusting Difficulty

**For Easier:**
- Reduce cultist numbers (3 fanatics instead of 4)
- Remove shadow demon encounter entirely
- Give Miriam's journal automatically
- Reduce zombie count to 4

**For Harder:**
- Add 2 shadows to the ritual chamber
- Shadow demon manifests at full strength (66 HP)
- Add a second cult leader
- Cultists have backup (2d4 cultists arrive as reinforcements)

### Mood and Atmosphere

**Sounds:**
- Dripping water
- Distant moaning (wind through tunnels)
- Whispers (use actual whispers for effect)
- Ritual chanting (use a low, rhythmic hum)

**Smells:**
- Decay and must
- Candle wax and incense (near cult areas)
- Metallic smell (dried blood)
- Cold, wet stone

**Visuals:**
- Shadows that move wrong
- Dim, flickering light from torches
- Ancient carvings and warnings
- Signs of struggle and violence

### Player Agency

Allow creative solutions:
- Collapsing tunnels to slow cultists
- Turning undead to avoid combat
- Negotiating with the cult (though they won't agree)
- Finding alternate routes
- Using environment (collapse ceiling on enemies, etc.)

### If Players Get Stuck

**Hints to drop:**
- Father Aldric mentions Miriam knows village history
- Thom's key is mentioned if players help him
- Investigation checks reveal cultist tracks
- NPCs can suggest talking to each other

**Don't:**
- Railro ad players to one solution
- Make NPCs solve problems for them
- Remove consequences of poor choices
- Skip important investigation

## Sequel Hooks

### The Cult Remains

Brother Malachi was just one of many cult leaders. His superiors will want revenge and to finish what he started.

### The Whispering Dark

If the party used the re-sealing ritual instead of destroying the obelisk, the entity still exists. It will try to manipulate others to free it.

### Other Seals

Miriam's journal mentions "other sites" where entities were sealed. Are they still secure?

### Plague Victims

What really happened to the original plague victims? Some families claim their ancestors never received proper burial.

### The Ring

The Ring of Mind Shielding contains Brother Malachi's soul (if he was wearing it when killed). He can communicate with whoever wears it and will try to corrupt them.
