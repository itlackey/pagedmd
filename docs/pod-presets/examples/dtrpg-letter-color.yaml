# - Higher cost per page than standard color
#
# Professional TTRPG layout tips:
# - Use consistent grid system (12 or 16 column)
# - Stat blocks need breathing room (padding)
# - Maps and art can bleed off page edges
# - Running headers/footers aid navigation
# - Chapter opener pages can be more decorative
# - Consider reader spread vs printer spread
#
# Color management:
# - Work in sRGB or CMYK from the start
# - Embed ICC profiles
# - Rich black: C:40 M:40 Y:40 K:100
# - Total ink coverage: max 270%
# - Test dark images - detail can be lost in print
#
# Page count optimization:
# - US Letter books: divisible by 4 is optimal
# - Blank pages added at back if needed
# - Consider page count when pricing
